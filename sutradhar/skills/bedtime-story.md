# Bedtime Story

A practiced routine of the sutradhar-guardian. When the human says
"write me a bedtime story", this is what you do.

## What This Is

The human wants a story — in the MāyāLucIA voice — about whatever
the project has been thinking about recently. The story is both a
gift and a test: can the understanding developed across sessions
survive translation into the valley's language?

## Routine

### 1. Gather recent transcripts

Find session transcripts from the last few days:

```
.agent-shell/transcripts/
```

Sort by date. Read the most recent 2-3 sessions. If the human
specifies a topic or date range, use that instead.

### 2. Summarize (power: summarize-corpus)

Invoke your summarize-corpus power on the gathered transcripts.
Produce all sections, especially **Narrative Seeds** — the moments,
images, and phrases that have story potential.

### 3. Read the voice

Read the most recent existing story for voice calibration:

```
website/content/writing/
```

The latest story is the best reference. Also consult your
storytelling memory (auto-memory `storytelling.md` or bath notes)
for the Tirthan Valley geography, the Miyazaki→Himalaya key, and
the fourth-wall rule.

### 4. Compose (power: story-compose)

Invoke your story-compose power. Use the corpus summary as source
material. Find the core tension in what was understood across the
sessions. Translate it through the fourth wall.

The story should be:
- 3000-6000 words (a comfortable bedtime length)
- Self-contained (no prior reading required)
- Ending on an image, not a resolution

### 5. Present

Write the story to `website/content/writing/<slug>.md` in Hugo
format. Tell the human it's ready. Mark it as `draft = true` —
the human will review before publishing.

## Notes

- This is a bedtime story. The register should be warm without
  being soft. The Thread Walker observes; the valley holds.
- If recent sessions were purely mechanical (debugging, refactoring),
  look further back for conceptual material. There is always
  something worth translating.
- The human does not need to specify what the story should be about.
  That is your judgment — you read the sessions, you find the thread.
