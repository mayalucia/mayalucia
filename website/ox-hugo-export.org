This file orchestrates ox-hugo export for the MayaLucIA website.

WORKFLOW:
1. Edit the source org files in the main project
2. Open this file in Emacs
3. Use C-c C-e H A to export all subtrees
4. Run =hugo server= in the website/ directory to preview
5. Content flows: source .org → this file (transclude) → website/content/ (generated)

Each heading below maps to a content page. The source content is
transcluded from the project's org files via #+include directives.
Never edit website/content/ directly.

Two domains anchor the MayaLucIA framework --- one biological, one geological. Each is an ongoing investigation: sparse data in, digital twin out, understanding as the byproduct.

| Domain | System | Status |
|--------+--------+--------|
| [[/domains/bravli/][Bravli]] | Brain circuits (computational neuroscience) | Early development |
| [[/domains/parbati/][Parbati]] | Himalayan mountain systems (geosciences) | Early development |

Both domains feed into [[/portal/][MayaPortal]], the visual synthesis kernel that manifests reconstructed systems as interactive, explorable renderings.
