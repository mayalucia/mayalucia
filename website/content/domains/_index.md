Two domains anchor the MayaLucIA framework --- one biological, one geological. Each is an ongoing investigation: sparse data in, digital twin out, understanding as the byproduct.

| Domain                       | System                                      | Status            |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Bravli](/domains/bravli/)   | Brain circuits (computational neuroscience) | Early development |
| [Parbati](/domains/parbati/) | Himalayan mountain systems (geosciences)    | Early development |

Both domains feed into [MayaPortal](/portal/), the visual synthesis kernel that manifests reconstructed systems as interactive, explorable renderings.
