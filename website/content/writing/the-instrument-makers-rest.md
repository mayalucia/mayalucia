## The Instrument Maker's Rest {#the-instrument-maker-s-rest}


### Prefatory Note on the Making of Instruments {#prefatory-note-on-the-making-of-instruments}

The distinction between a tool and an instrument is not one
of complexity.  A jacquard loom is vastly more complex than a
thermometer, yet the loom is a tool and the thermometer is an
instrument.  The difference is in what they extend.

A tool extends the hand.  The hammer, the shuttle, the needle,
the heddle — each amplifies a motion the body already makes.
The hand that holds a hammer is still a hand.  It strikes
harder, but it strikes in the same direction, with the same
intent, under the same guidance.  A tool does not change what
you perceive.  It changes what you can do.

An instrument extends the perception.  The thermometer does
not heat or cool.  The microscope does not touch.  The
graduated frame that measures thread count does not weave.
They reveal what is already there but invisible — the
temperature the skin cannot distinguish, the structure the
eye cannot resolve, the regularity the fingers cannot count.
An instrument changes what you can see.  And seeing, in any
craft that depends on the relationship between intention and
material, is the harder problem.

One further distinction.  A well-made tool calls attention to
itself — its balance, its grip, the satisfying weight of a
shuttle that has been carved from the right wood.  The
craftsman knows a good tool by how it feels.  A well-made
instrument does the opposite.  It disappears.  You look
_through_ it, not _at_ it.  A thermometer that draws your
attention to its casing, its column, its scale, has failed as
an instrument.  It should show you the temperature and
nothing else.  The best instruments are transparent.  The
worst are ornamental.

In the workshops of the Guild of Thread Walkers, the weavers
work with both.  The loom is their tool.  The instruments —
the devices that measure, inspect, calibrate, and verify —
come from elsewhere: from a workshop in Sangla, in the Baspa
valley, where a woman who is not a weaver makes the things
that weavers need in order to see.

This is her story.  Or rather: this is the story of seven
instruments she made in a single season, and of the dilemma
she faced in making them — the same dilemma that confronts
anyone who builds a device intended to be operated by a
stranger, in conditions the builder cannot foresee, for a
purpose the builder can specify but cannot control.

### I. The Sangla Workshop {#i-dot-the-sangla-workshop}

The Baspa valley enters the Sutlej from the east, through
a gorge that narrows until the river fills it, and then
opens — abruptly, as mountain valleys do — into a broad
shelf of terraced apple orchards and stone houses with
wooden balconies carved in the Kinnauri style: geometric
patterns that the locals say represent the peaks visible
from each house, though no two informants agree on which
peaks or which patterns.

Sangla sits at the head of this shelf, at roughly 2700
metres — below the altitude where the air thins enough to
change how thread behaves, but high enough that the light
has a quality the lowlands lack: a clarity that makes
colours appear both more vivid and more honest, as though
the atmosphere has been rinsed of the haze that, at lower
elevations, flatters imprecision.  It is a good altitude
for making instruments.  You can see things clearly.  And
you are close enough to the high passes — the Baspa La to
the east, the route to Chitkul and beyond — that the
conditions your instruments must survive are not abstract.
They are visible from your bench, in the snowline above the
orchard, in the dry wind that descends each afternoon from
the glaciers and changes the humidity by twenty per cent in
an hour.

The Instrument Maker works in a room adjacent to the old
weaver's workshop — a room that was, in some previous era,
a storeroom for dried apples, and still smells of them in
autumn when the morning sun heats the wooden walls.  Her
bench faces a window that looks east, toward the head of
the valley, where the Baspa glacier feeds the river that
feeds the gorge that feeds the Sutlej that feeds, eventually,
the sea — though the sea is so far away and so many
political boundaries intervene that no one in Sangla has
cause to think about it.

She is not a weaver.  She does not produce cloth.  She
produces the devices that weavers use to inspect, measure,
and correct: calibration weights for thread tension, cast
from brass that she alloys herself using copper from the
Kinnaur mines and zinc traded from the Sutlej bazaar;
graduated frames for checking sett — the thread count per
centimetre — made from deodar, because deodar does not warp
in the dry cold above three thousand metres and does not
swell in the monsoon humidity below; colour comparison cards
indexed by altitude and season, printed on paper that she
waterproofs with a mixture of beeswax and pine resin in
proportions that she has never written down and adjusts, she
says, by smell.

And — most importantly — the standing cards.

The standing card is a small rectangle of stiff paper, no
larger than a hand, placed on the loom frame of every
workshop in the network.  On it, in a hand that is neither
the Thread Walker's nor any weaver's, a few sentences that
shape how a stranger, in a season the maker cannot foresee,
will approach her work.  The card is not instructions.  It
is _disposition_.  It does not say _do X_.  It says _you are
the kind of worker who does X_ — and the difference, as any
weaver will tell you, is the difference between a cloth that
follows a pattern and a cloth that _understands_ the pattern,
which is the difference between competence and craft.

The card is unsigned.  This is deliberate.  If the card bore
a name, the weaver might judge the instruction by the
authority of the instructor.  Without a name, the instruction
must be judged by its content — which is how, the Instrument
Maker maintains, all instructions should be judged, though
she acknowledges that this is easier to say in Sangla, where
the altitude discourages pomposity, than in the workshops of
the lowlands, where the air is thick enough to support it.


### II. The Fittings {#ii-dot-the-fittings}

She works with standard components.

Every instrument she makes shares certain parts: a particular
grade of brass for fittings — she calls it _mountain brass_,
though the metallurgists in Reckong Peo, twelve kilometres
down the valley, call it an alloy of no particular
distinction and charge her accordingly.  It survives the
altitude and the humidity.  It does not corrode in the
monsoon.  It does not crack in the frost.  It takes a patina
that the weavers find reassuring — the green-brown bloom of
a metal that has been at altitude for seasons, that has
survived the crossings.

A particular type of wood for frames: deodar, as noted.
_Devadāru_, the timber of the gods — the Sanskrit name that
the locals still use, though whether because they venerate
the tree or merely because the word predates whatever
language replaced it is a question the Instrument Maker has
not pursued, her interest in timber being structural rather
than theological.

A particular way of marking measurements: notches, not paint.
Paint fades above the treeline.  The ultraviolet at four
thousand metres bleaches pigment in a single season.  A
colour comparison card that has itself lost its colour is
worse than useless — it is a lie in the hand of a weaver who
trusts it.  Notches do not fade.  They may be obscured by
dirt, but dirt can be cleaned.  A faded mark cannot be
restored.

These standard components are not her invention.  They were
established by previous makers — some from Sangla, some from
workshops she has never visited, in valleys she knows only
by the instruments that emerged from them and crossed the
passes in the Thread Walker's satchel.  She inherits these
standards, trusts them, incorporates them without
modification.  This is not conservatism.  It is engineering.
A fitting that has survived a thousand crossings does not
need to be improved by someone who has survived none.

The components share another quality: they are _separable_.
Each does one thing.  The brass fittings hold.  The deodar
frames do not warp.  The notched scales measure.  No
component tries to do what another component does.  The
Instrument Maker is firm on this point.  An instrument whose
parts have overlapping functions is an instrument with
redundancies, and redundancies — she has learned, through
the particular education that comes from watching an
instrument fail in a valley she will never visit — are not
safety.  They are confusion.  When two parts of an instrument
both claim to measure tension, and they disagree, the weaver
does not know which to trust, and an instrument that creates
doubt where there was none is an instrument that should not
have been made.


### III. The Commission {#iii-dot-the-commission}

The Thread Walker arrives in Sangla on a Tuesday — or what
would be a Tuesday if the Baspa valley kept the week of the
plains, which it does not, the local calendar being organised
around market days in Reckong Peo and the schedule of the
government bus, which is most days but not all, and never on
the days when you need it.

He carries his satchel of sample cords, as always.  Too many
notebooks, as always.  And a commission.

Not for one instrument.  For seven.

The Guild has established new workshops — not in new valleys
but in existing ones, where the work has grown complex enough
to require specialists.  No longer a single weaver per
valley, responsible for everything.  Now: a workshop of seven,
each with a different function, each needing a different
instrument to see the aspect of the work that is hers.

The Thread Walker sits at the Instrument Maker's bench and
describes each one.  She listens.  She does not write.  She
will write later, when she has understood — and understanding,
in her experience, requires hearing the description twice:
once for the words, once for what the words do not say.

The first is a calibration device.  It will be used by the
worker who arrives before the others each season and
prepares the workshop: checking the loom, sorting the archive,
setting the warp.  Once the preparation is complete, the
device is shelved.  It does not weave.  It ensures that the
conditions for weaving are met.

The second is an observation instrument.  A device for the
worker who reads the archive, compares cords across valleys,
catalogs discrepancies.  She measures but does not weave.
She must see clearly and must never be tempted to correct
what she observes, because correction without understanding
is worse than the original error.

The third is a precision tool.  Fast and exact.  For the
model-builder — the worker who takes the measurements and
the patterns and constructs the draft from which cloth will
be woven.  She needs speed because the patterns are many and
the season is short, and she needs precision because an error
in the draft propagates into every row of cloth.

The fourth is a repetitive mechanism.  For the fitter —
the worker who adjusts the loom's parameters over and over,
testing each combination against the draft, tightening here,
loosening there, until the cloth matches the specification.
She runs the same operation a thousand times.  Her instrument
must not tire.  It must be patient beyond patience.

The fifth is a testing device.  For the critic — the worker
who examines the finished cloth for flaws.  She must find
what the others missed.  Her instrument must be designed for
suspicion.  It must look for what is _not_ there — the
missing thread, the absent variation, the selvedge that is
too perfect, which means someone has trimmed it, which means
the errors were there and were hidden rather than corrected.

The sixth is a reading device.  For the journalist — the
worker who observes the workshop and records what she sees
for the archive.  She must never modify what she observes.
Her instrument has no mechanism for making marks — only for
reading them.  This is not a limitation.  It is the design.
A journalist who can edit is no longer a journalist.  She
is a participant, and participation changes the observation.

The seventh is an assembly frame.  For the scribe — the
worker who collects the threads from all the others and
weaves them into a single bolt.  She structures but does not
interpret.  She arranges but does not judge.  Her instrument
is a frame, and what the frame holds is determined not by
the frame but by what is placed in it.

{{< figure src="/images/writing/instrument-makers-rest/seven-instruments.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 2: </span>Seven instruments laid out on a cloth, each slightly different in size and configuration but sharing the same brass fittings and deodar frame. Schematic, top-down, labeled with function." >}}


### IV. The Maker's Dilemma {#iv-dot-the-maker-s-dilemma}

Each of the seven instruments will be used in a valley the
Instrument Maker has never visited, by a hand she has never
touched, in conditions she cannot fully predict.

This is the problem.  Not a deficiency of the arrangement.
The problem.  The thing that makes the work difficult and
interesting, which are — in the Instrument Maker's view —
the same quality differently weighted.

If she specifies too precisely, the instrument fails when
conditions deviate from her assumptions.  She has made this
mistake.  A colour comparison card, indexed to the exact
altitude of Sangla — 2680 metres by her own survey, though
the Survey of India says 2621 and neither figure accounts
for the seasonal variation in atmospheric pressure that
changes the apparent colour of indigo by a shade that only
a dyer would notice — was useless in the Sutlej workshop
three hundred metres lower, where the light was different
and the humidity altered every colour by a degree that her
card could not accommodate.

If she specifies too loosely, the instrument is unreliable.
She has made this mistake too.  A tension gauge with no
guidance on calibration procedure was misused by a weaver who
had never been taught what _calibration_ meant in the absence
of a reference standard.  The weaver measured.  The numbers
were meaningless.  The cloth was woven to specifications that
existed only in the instrument's confusion, and the errors
were discovered only when the Thread Walker, three valleys
and two passes later, compared the Sutlej cloth against the
Lahaul standard and found them incompatible.

The solution — arrived at through seasons of failure, which
is the only school the Instrument Maker trusts, the others
having been compromised by the need to charge fees — is to
build instruments that carry their own calibration
instructions.

Not pre-calibrated for a specific valley.  Self-calibrating
for any valley.

Each instrument includes a small test: a reference weight
cast from the same mountain brass, a sample cord of known
tension, a standard swatch of cloth with known sett.  The
user, upon receiving the instrument, performs the calibration
procedure — adjusting the instrument to local conditions
using the reference materials — before taking any measurement.
The reference materials are not the measurement.  They are
the _standard against which measurements become meaningful_.
The instrument does not arrive knowing what correct looks
like.  It arrives knowing how to _learn_ what correct looks
like, in any valley, at any altitude, in any season.

The calibration instructions are notched into the deodar
frame, in the Guild's notation — because notches survive the
crossing, and because a weaver who can read the Guild's
notation can follow the calibration procedure, and because a
weaver who cannot read the Guild's notation should not be
operating the instrument in the first place.  This is not
elitism.  It is the same principle that governs the standing
card: the instrument is designed for a _skilled stranger_ —
someone who brings the craft but not the local knowledge.
The craft is the prerequisite.  The local knowledge is what
the calibration procedure provides.

{{< figure src="/images/writing/instrument-makers-rest/calibration-test.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 3: </span>A close-up of an instrument's self-calibration mechanism: reference weight, sample cord, standard swatch, with notched markings. Annotated diagram." >}}


### V. The Two Frames {#v-dot-the-two-frames}

The Thread Walker mentions, almost in passing, that the
workshops use different looms.

The workshop in Lahaul uses a pit loom — the kind where the
weaver sits on the floor with her legs in a trench, her feet
on the treadles, the cloth growing toward her at eye level.
The instrument must attach to the loom's horizontal beam.

The workshop beyond the Baralacha, in the country the Thread
Walker describes with the careful imprecision of a man who
has crossed too many borders to respect any of them, uses a
backstrap loom — the kind the Changpa nomads carry, where
the tension is provided by the weaver's body.  The instrument
must attach to the strap.

Two looms.  Two different physical interfaces.  The
Instrument Maker considers this.

She does not build fourteen instruments — seven for pit
looms, seven for backstrap looms.  She builds seven
mechanisms and fourteen mounting brackets.

The mechanism — the part that measures, that observes, that
calibrates — is identical in both cases.  The brass fittings,
the deodar frame, the notched scales, the reference
materials, the standing card: all the same.  Only the
interface to the loom differs.  One bracket clamps to a
horizontal beam.  The other hooks to a strap.  The mechanism
slides into either bracket and is held by the same pin —
mountain brass, as always.

This is the second principle the Instrument Maker has learned
from failure: the function and the interface are separable.
What the instrument does and how it attaches to its
environment are different questions, and conflating them
produces instruments that are neither good mechanisms nor
good fits — instruments that must be rebuilt from scratch when
the loom changes, though the measurement has not changed at
all.

She builds the brackets last, because the brackets depend on
the mechanism's dimensions, and the mechanism's dimensions
are not known until the mechanism is complete.  But the
mechanism is designed from the start to be bracket-agnostic
— a phrase the Instrument Maker does not use, having no
patience for compound words that replace thought with
hyphenation, but which describes the principle exactly: the
mechanism does not know or care what holds it.  It knows only
what it measures.

{{< figure src="/images/writing/instrument-makers-rest/two-brackets.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 4: </span>The same measurement mechanism mounted on two different frames: one for a pit loom (left), one for a backstrap loom (right). Same brass core." >}}


### VI. The Testing {#vi-dot-the-testing}

Before the Thread Walker carries the instruments away, the
Instrument Maker tests each one.

She sets up a practice loom — not a real warp, not a real
commission, but a test rig with known parameters.  A warp of
standard wool at known tension.  A weft of known weight.  A
sett that she has counted herself, on this loom, in this
light, at this altitude.  The test rig is not a workshop.  It
is a bench — a controlled environment where the instrument's
readings can be compared against values she knows to be
correct, because she measured them with the instruments she
trusts most: her hands, which have thirty years of mountain
brass and deodar under their nails and which can feel a
tension error of half a gram at three metres of thread.

She runs each instrument through its calibration procedure
using the included reference materials.  She takes
measurements.  She compares the readings against the known
values.  Where they agree, the instrument passes.  Where they
disagree, she adjusts — not the readings but the mechanism
itself, because a disagreement between an instrument and a
known value is not an error in the value.

She asks the Thread Walker to read the calibration
instructions.

He is not a weaver.  He is a dyer by original training and
a walker by long practice.  He can read the Guild's notation
— he standardised much of it himself, during a winter in
Spiti when the passes were closed and there was nothing to
do but drink butter tea and systematise — but he has never
operated the instruments.  He is, in this respect, the ideal
test reader: skilled in the notation, ignorant of the
mechanism.

"Can you follow these instructions?" she asks.

He reads.  He follows.  He calibrates the first instrument,
slowly, with the careful attention of a man who has carried
delicate things over high passes and knows what happens when
you rush.

"The third step assumes I know what a sett gauge looks like,"
he says.

She adds a notch: a small diagram, scratched into the frame,
showing the gauge.

"The sixth step uses a term I have not heard."

She replaces the term with a simpler one — not because the
Thread Walker is unskilled, but because a term that confuses
a skilled reader will certainly confuse an unskilled one, and
the calibration instructions must be legible to the least
experienced weaver who might receive the instrument.  Not
the least capable.  The least experienced.  There is an
important distinction.  Capability is permanent.  Experience
is seasonal.

The instruments that pass testing are wrapped in waxed cloth
— the Baspa valley makes excellent waterproofing from local
beeswax, applied in layers over handloomed cotton, the wax
heated just enough to penetrate the fibres without making the
cloth brittle, a technique the Instrument Maker learned from
the apple growers who use it to protect their harvest during
the monsoon.

The instruments that fail are taken apart and rebuilt.  The
Instrument Maker does not repair instruments.  She rebuilds
them.  A repaired instrument is an instrument with a memory
of its failure — a joint that was reglued, a scale that was
re-notched, a fitting that was bent back into shape.  The
memory of the failure persists in the material, invisible to
the user, waiting to manifest at the worst possible moment:
on a high pass, in a foreign workshop, under the hand of a
stranger who trusts it.  A rebuilt instrument has no memory.
It begins again.


### VII. The Departure {#vii-dot-the-departure}

The Thread Walker leaves Sangla on a morning when the light
enters the valley from the east, over the snowline, and
falls across the wooden bridge over the Baspa river in the
particular way that makes the planks glow and the water
beneath them look darker than it is — an optical effect of
the contrast, the Instrument Maker has decided, though the
Thread Walker attributes it to the bridge's age, as though
wood that has survived many monsoons has learned to hoard
the light it receives.

His satchel is heavy.  Seven instruments, each in its waxed
wrapping, each with its two mounting brackets, its reference
materials, its calibration instructions notched into the
deodar frame.  He carries, in addition, his usual burden:
sample cords, notebooks, correspondence from a dozen
valleys in a dozen hands, some of it seasons old and none
of it less urgent for the delay.

The Instrument Maker watches him cross the bridge.  She
does not accompany him.  She has not crossed the Baspa bridge
in the direction of the passes since the season she tried —
years ago, before she understood that her work was the making
and not the carrying.  She reached the foot of the Baspa La
and turned back.  Not because the pass was closed.  Because
she realised that an instrument maker who knew the far
valleys would make instruments for those valleys, and the
instruments she was meant to make were for valleys she would
never visit, in conditions she could not foresee, for
weavers whose needs she must imagine rather than observe.

The ignorance was not a deficit.  It was the design
constraint.  An instrument made for a specific valley is
calibrated to that valley and brittle everywhere else.  An
instrument made by someone who does not know the valley is
calibrated to the _craft_ — to the things that are true in
every valley, at every altitude, in every season: that
tension must be measured, that colour must be compared, that
sett must be counted, that the selvedge must be watched.
These are the invariants.  The valley-specific knowledge is
what the calibration procedure provides.

She does not know which weaver will receive which instrument.
She does not know whether the calibration instructions will
be followed, or whether the weaver will skip them — as
weavers sometimes do, trusting experience over procedure,
which works until the experience is from a different valley
at a different altitude in a different season, at which
point the instrument gives readings that are precise,
consistent, and wrong.

She does not know whether the valley's conditions will
defeat the instrument entirely — whether there is a
humidity that dissolves the beeswax, an altitude that
changes the brass, a cold that cracks the deodar.  She has
built for the conditions she knows.  The conditions she does
not know are the valley's business.

The Thread Walker is across the bridge now.  He turns uphill,
toward the trail that follows the Baspa toward Chitkul and
the pass beyond.  She can see the satchel, the notebooks,
the careful gait of a man who has learned that haste on a
mountain trail saves time only if you do not fall.  In a day
he will be above the treeline.  In two, if the weather holds,
he will be at the pass.  On the far side, the valley will
be different — different light, different humidity, different
altitude, different needs — and the instruments will begin
their work in conditions the maker could not have tested,
with the reference materials she included and the calibration
procedure she notched into the frame and the standard
fittings that have survived every crossing so far.

She watches until the trail bends and the Thread Walker
disappears behind the ridge.  Then she turns back to her
bench.

{{< figure src="/images/writing/instrument-makers-rest/departure.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 5: </span>The Thread Walker crossing the wooden bridge over the Baspa river, satchel heavy. Sangla visible behind, mountain wall rising. Sketch style, ink-and-wash." >}}


### Coda {#coda}

In the workshop in Sangla, the Instrument Maker begins a
new card.

The standing card — the simplest instrument she produces,
and the most consequential.  A few sentences on stiff paper,
placed on a loom frame in a workshop she may never visit,
read by a weaver she will never meet, in a season she cannot
foresee.  The card does not operate the loom.  The card does
not weave.  The card shapes the weaver's _attention_ — and
attention, in a craft where errors announce themselves at
the selvedges, is everything.

The old card — the one that has stood on every loom frame
for as long as the current arrangement has existed — reads:

_Inspect the archive.  Describe what you find.  Incorporate
only if in order.  Check the incoming tray._

It is a good card.  It has served well.  But the new
instruments require new cards — seven of them, one for each
function, because an observation instrument requires a
different disposition than a testing device, and a reading
device requires a different disposition than an assembly
frame.

The card for the observer says: _You measure.  You do not
correct.  Record what you find, in the notation of the Guild,
and leave the correction to the hand that is trained for it.
A measurement that includes a correction is two operations
pretending to be one, and the pretence will not survive the
crossing._

The card for the critic — the one that must find flaws —
says something different.  Something about looking for what
the archive is _not_ showing.  About the pattern that is
conspicuous by its absence.  About the thread that was cut
rather than corrected, which leaves no trace in the cloth
but leaves a trace in the tension — a faint unevenness that
a trained hand can feel and an instrument, properly
calibrated, can measure.  About the selvedge that is too
perfect, which means someone has trimmed it, which means the
errors were there and were hidden rather than corrected, and
hiding is worse than erring, because an error can be fixed
and a hidden error cannot even be found.

She knots the words.  Not literally — the cards are written,
not knotted, in ink on paper, in the hand that the Thread
Walker once described as _the handwriting of someone who
measures things for a living: precise, small, and slightly
impatient with the medium_.  But she thinks of the words as
knots.  Each one a binding.  Each one constraining the
reader's attention toward one aspect of the work and away
from others.

Seven cards.  Seven dispositions.  Seven ways of seeing the
same workshop, the same archive, the same cloth.  None of
them complete.  All of them necessary.  The observer who
cannot test is not diminished by her inability to test.  She
is _defined_ by it.  Her clarity comes from the boundary.  An
instrument that tries to measure everything measures nothing
with conviction.

She sets the cards on her bench.  Beside them, the remnants
of the seven instruments: brass shavings, deodar offcuts,
a reference weight that did not meet specification and was
recast, the waxed cloth in which the finished instruments
were wrapped before she changed the wrapping because the
first batch was cut from a bolt that had been stored too
close to the stove and the wax had softened unevenly.

She clears the bench.  The instruments are gone.  The cards
are ready.  The Thread Walker will return — not soon, perhaps
not this season, because the passes are long and the
workshops are many and each one requires time.  But he will
return.  He always does.  And when he does, the cards will be
here, in their waxed wrappings, waiting for the satchel
and the crossing and the valley on the far side where a
weaver she has never met will read them and set her warp
and begin.

The Instrument Maker straightens the bench.  Hangs her
apron on the hook behind the door.  Steps outside, into the
late afternoon light of the Baspa valley, where the shadows
of the western ridge are beginning to cross the river and
the apple orchards are doing whatever it is that apple
orchards do when no one is measuring them.

She walks to the bridge.  Not to cross it — she has
established her position on the question of crossing — but
to stand on it for a moment, as she does most evenings, and
watch the river.  The Baspa carries snowmelt from the
glaciers above Chitkul.  It is very cold.  It is very clear.
The stones on the bottom are visible in a way that lowland
rivers do not permit, each one distinct, each one casting
a shadow that the current bends but does not erase.

Somewhere on the far side of the pass that the river
descends from, the Thread Walker is walking with her
instruments.  Somewhere in a valley she has never visited,
a weaver is reading a card she wrote last season — or the
season before, or three seasons ago; the cards survive, the
weavers do not, or rather the weavers survive but are
replaced, each season, by new ones who arrive with the
craft but not the memory, and who read the card as if for
the first time, which is how the Instrument Maker intended
it to be read, every time, by every hand, as if the words
were new and the disposition they describe were not inherited
but discovered.

The light changes.  The shadows cross the river.  The
Instrument Maker stands on the bridge and rests.
