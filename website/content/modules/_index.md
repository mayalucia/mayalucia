Computational modules form the engine layer of MayaLucIA --- each a self-contained codebase with its own focus, but all sharing the same architectural principles: literate programming, functional composition, and understanding through creation.

| Module | Focus | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| [MāyāPramāṇa](/modules/mayapramana/) | Quantum sensor digital twins (Bell-Bloom magnetometer) | Early development |
| [MāyāJīva](/modules/mayajiva/) | Magnetic bug simulation (radical-pair magnetoreception) | Research complete |
| [MāyāPortal](/portal/) | Visual synthesis kernel (C++23, WebGPU) | Lesson 00 complete |
| [Sūtradhār](/modules/sutradhar/) | Project self-awareness --- reads the relay, holds the thread (Clojure) | Foundation complete |

All modules feed into the [domains](/domains/) --- brain circuits and mountain valleys --- where the science meets the world.
