#+title: Seed — Project Management for a Human+AI Research Org
#+date: February 2026

* Context

MāyāLucIA has grown from a single repo experiment into an organisation
with 7 GitHub repos, multiple active workstreams, one human (visood),
and AI collaborators (Claude sessions, potentially gptel-guide in
Emacs). No persistent AI memory across sessions beyond MEMORY.md and
what's written into files.

Traditional project management doesn't fit:
- No stable team (each AI session starts fresh)
- No predictable velocity (human availability varies)
- No sprint cadence (work is curiosity-driven, not deadline-driven)
- No product manager (the human is researcher, architect, and PM)

We need something that works with:
- Org-mode (human's native environment)
- MEMORY.md (Claude's persistent memory)
- Session seeds (context bootstrapping for new sessions)
- Artifact-centric memory (MayaDevGenI principle)
- Git (the backbone of everything)

* Current State

** What exists
- =project/project.org= — master thread tracker (just written)
- =project/seeds/= — session seed documents (just started)
- =MEMORY.md= — Claude-specific persistent memory
- =CLAUDE.md= — agent onboarding instructions
- =collab/index.org= — earlier session-tracking pattern
- =agency/mayalucia-agency.org= — agency framework with roles and protocols
- MayaDevGenI handoff protocol (Context/Deliverable/Request/Constraints/Open Questions)

** What does not exist
- A convergence practice (when/how to review project.org)
- Decision log
- Cross-repo dependency tracking
- A way for the human to quickly brief a new AI session
  ("pick up thread X" → agent reads seed → has full context)
- Integration between project.org and GitHub issues (for when
  collaborators join)

* The Challenge

The fundamental tension: the human has deep, continuous context but
limited time. The AI has unlimited time but no persistent context
(each session is a blank slate plus whatever files it reads).

The bridge between them is /written artifacts/. Everything the human
knows that an AI session needs must be written down — but not
everything, only what's needed for the current task. The art is
knowing what to write, where to write it, and when to update it.

** What works now
- MEMORY.md gives any Claude session the basics (repos, conventions,
  current state, next steps)
- CLAUDE.md gives the stance and methodology
- Session seeds give thread-specific context
- project.org gives the big picture

** What's missing
- A lightweight practice for keeping these in sync
- A way to track decisions that span multiple sessions
- A way to notice when seeds are stale
- A "standup" equivalent that's async and org-native

* Design Options

** Option A: Org-Native Everything
project.org is the single source of truth. All tracking in org TODO
items with properties. Seeds are subsections or linked files. The
human reviews in Emacs. AI sessions read and update.

Pro: everything in one ecosystem, human can use org-agenda.
Con: project.org grows large; AI sessions may not update it.

** Option B: project.org + GitHub Issues
project.org tracks the big picture and internal threads. GitHub issues
track concrete tasks that could involve external collaborators (when
Saikat joins). AI sessions create issues for work they can't finish.

Pro: external-facing when needed. Con: two systems to keep in sync.

** Option C: Seed-Centric
No master tracker. Each thread has a seed. The human maintains a list
of seeds. Starting a session = pointing the agent at a seed. The seed
is self-contained.

Pro: simple, decentralised. Con: no overview, easy to lose threads.

** Proposed: A + elements of B
- project.org as master tracker (org-native, human reviews in Emacs)
- Seeds for thread-specific context (agent bootstrapping)
- GitHub issues only for external-facing tasks or when collaborators join
- MEMORY.md as agent-specific cache (Claude reads this; other agents
  may have their own)
- Convergence practice: after any multi-session burst, update
  project.org before stopping

* Convergence Practice (Draft)

At the end of a work session (or the start of the next one):

1. *Read project.org* — is the state description still accurate?
2. *Update thread states* — mark what's done, what's blocked, what's new
3. *Prune seeds* — delete or rewrite seeds that are stale
4. *Update MEMORY.md* — if anything changed that a fresh session needs
5. *Note decisions* — if any architectural decisions were made, log them

This takes 5 minutes. The cost of not doing it is a 30-minute
context-recovery next time.

* Next Steps

1. *Trial the current system* — use project.org + seeds for the next
   few sessions. See what's missing.
2. *Write a convergence checklist* — a short org template for the
   end-of-session review.
3. *Decide on GitHub issues* — when Saikat joins, we'll need them.
   Define the threshold.
4. *Agent auto-update* — can we instruct agents (via CLAUDE.md) to
   update project.org and MEMORY.md as part of their session?
