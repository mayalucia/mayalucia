#+title: Seed — Literate Agency
#+subtitle: Conventions for org documents as shared substrate between human and machine
#+date: February 2026

* What This Is

One thread, merging three:
- Embedded pedagogical prompts (syntax for expansion points)
- Agent-readable lessons (how agents read and act on org files)
- Project management (how human and agents stay coherent)

The common root: org files as the shared substrate between human and
machine intelligences. The deliverable is a conventions document and
a working prototype (lesson 00 annotated with the new conventions).

* The Single Insight

An org file can carry structured annotations — in properties, in
special blocks, in header metadata — that give agents handles to act
on the document, without compromising its readability for humans. The
annotations are not separate from the content. They are /part of/ the
content, the way margin notes are part of a book.

Three kinds of annotation, one pattern:

| Kind | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| *Prompt blocks* | "Understanding needed here" — agent expands on demand | =#+BEGIN_PROMPT= with role, level, prereqs |
| *Lesson metadata* | "Here is what this document defines" — agent reads manifest | =#+LESSON:=, =#+DEFINES:=, =#+DEPENDS:= |
| *Session state* | "Here is where we are" — agent resumes work | Seed files, project.org thread entries |

All three are the same gesture: a human writes something structured
into an org file, and a machine reads it to act intelligently.

* Current State

** What exists
- MāyāPramāṇa lesson 00 (Bloch equations, trilingual)
- MayaDevGenI agency framework (6 roles, handoff protocol)
- gptel-guide agent (Emacs-native, propose-and-wait)
- project.org as master thread tracker
- Session seeds for individual threads (now merged into this one)

** What does not exist
- The conventions document (=literate-agency.org= or section in conventions.org)
- Any prompt blocks in any lesson
- Lesson header metadata in any lesson
- An end-of-session / start-of-session protocol in CLAUDE.md
- A test: fresh agent session reading annotated lesson 00 and acting on it

* Method

Work in this order:

1. *Draft the conventions* — write the literate-agency section as an
   org document. Syntax for prompt blocks, lesson metadata format,
   session protocol. Keep it short — one page of conventions, not ten.

2. *Annotate lesson 00* — apply the conventions to the Bloch equations
   lesson. Add 2-3 prompt blocks where a first-year grad student would
   need help. Add the lesson header metadata. This is the prototype.

3. *Test with a fresh session* — start a new agent session, point it
   at the annotated lesson 00, and see if it can:
   (a) read the metadata and summarise what the lesson defines
   (b) find a prompt block and generate a contextual tutorial
   (c) understand the lesson well enough to extend it

4. *Refine* — based on what worked and what didn't, update the
   conventions. This is the Measure-Model-Manifest-Evaluate cycle
   applied to the conventions themselves.

5. *Codify* — add the session protocol to CLAUDE.md. Add the
   conventions to mayapramana's conventions.org. Update project.org.

* Open Questions (to resolve during the work)

- How much context does the agent include when expanding a prompt?
- Are generated tutorials cached or ephemeral?
- Does the lesson manifest use org properties or header keywords?
- How minimal can the annotations be while still being useful?
- Can the same conventions work for MāyāLucIA broadly (not just mayapramana)?
