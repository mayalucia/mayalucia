#+title: Seed — Saikat Invitation & Outreach
#+date: February 2026

* Context

Dr. Saikat Ghosh is a quantum physicist at IIT Kanpur — atomic
magnetometers, quantum-enhanced sensing, field-deployable instruments,
Qmet Tech. A friend of Vishal's. We are inviting him to join MāyāLucIA
as a partner and to engage with MāyāPramāṇa, which was built for his
instruments.

The deeper connection: the same quantum sensors Saikat builds for
laboratory quantum optics are now being used for brain imaging
(wearable MEG with OPMs), cardiology (MCG), and portable diagnostics.
The Bloch equations in lesson 00 are the physics of both his
magnetometers and MRI. A universal quantum sensor controller is a tool
for neuroscience as much as for quantum optics.

* Current State

** Invitation letter
- =invitations/saikat-ghosh.org= (org format)
- =invitations/saikat-ghosh.md= (markdown, same content)
- Leads with MāyāPramāṇa repo, EM fields in the brain, applications.org
- Asks: (1) break the models, (2) join as partner
- Closes with Kabir's gardener verse

** MāyāPramāṇa (what Saikat would see)
- Repo: https://github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana
- manifesto.org — philosophical grounding (Dignāga, Kabir, Feynman, Bohr)
- applications.org — neuroscience, cardiology, ULF-MRI, point-of-care
- architecture.org — FP grammar for sensor control
- lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org — first lesson
- site/index.html — wireframe (NOT YET DEPLOYED as a live site)

** What "presentable" means
The invitation links to the repo and eventually to a live site. For
the invitation to land, Saikat should be able to:
1. Read the manifesto and feel it was written for him (DONE)
2. Clone the repo and see real code with tests (DONE, lesson 00 exists)
3. Visit a live demo that shows the digital twin working interactively
   (NOT DONE — this is the UQSC web interface, thread 1)

The live demo is the difference between "here is a manifesto" and
"here is a working prototype." The invitation can be sent with just
the repo, but the demo makes it viscerally compelling.

* Decision Needed

When to send: now (repo only) or after the UQSC demo is live?

Vishal's call. The letter works either way — it was written to be
readable without a demo. But "clone it and run the tests" is stronger
than "look at the website."
