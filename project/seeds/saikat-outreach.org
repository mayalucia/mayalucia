#+title: Seed — Saikat Invitation & Outreach
#+date: February 2026

* Context

Dr. Saikat Ghosh is a quantum physicist at IIT Kanpur — atomic
magnetometers, quantum-enhanced sensing, field-deployable instruments,
Qmet Tech. A friend of Vishal's. We are inviting him to join MāyāLucIA
as a partner and to engage with MāyāPramāṇa, which was built for his
instruments.

The deeper connection: the same quantum sensors Saikat builds for
laboratory quantum optics are now being used for brain imaging
(wearable MEG with OPMs), cardiology (MCG), and portable diagnostics.
The Bloch equations in lesson 00 are the physics of both his
magnetometers and MRI. A universal quantum sensor controller is a tool
for neuroscience as much as for quantum optics.

* Current State

** Invitation letter
- =invitations/saikat-ghosh.org= (org format)
- =invitations/saikat-ghosh.md= (markdown, same content)
- Leads with MāyāPramāṇa repo, EM fields in the brain, applications.org
- Asks: (1) break the models, (2) join as partner
- Closes with Kabir's gardener verse

** MāyāPramāṇa (what Saikat would see) — updated 2026-02-20
- Repo: https://github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana
- manifesto.org — philosophical grounding (Dignāga, Kabir, Feynman, Bohr)
- applications.org — neuroscience, cardiology, ULF-MRI, point-of-care
- architecture.org — FP grammar for sensor control
- lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org — first lesson, MāyāLoom annotated
- site/index.html — INTERACTIVE DEMO: 3D Bloch sphere, live signal
  plot, sliders for B/T1/T2/M0, presets, RK4 integrator. Self-contained
  HTML. Not yet deployed to GitHub Pages.

** What "presentable" means
1. Read the manifesto and feel it was written for him (DONE)
2. Clone the repo and see real code with tests (DONE, lesson 00)
3. Open site/index.html and see the digital twin working interactively
   (DONE — interactive demo built, needs GitHub Pages deployment)

* Decision Needed

When to send: now (repo + local HTML) or after GitHub Pages deployment?

The demo works as a local HTML file — Saikat can clone the repo and
open site/index.html directly. GitHub Pages would make it one click.
Invitation is being rewritten this session to include the demo link.
