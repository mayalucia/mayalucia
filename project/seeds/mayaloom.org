#+title: Seed — MāyāLoom: Annotate Lesson 00
#+date: February 2026

* Context

MāyāLoom is MāyāLucIA's convention for org files as shared substrate
between human and machine intelligences. Named for Kabir's loom: tānā
(warp, the human-written document) and bānā (weft, the agent's
contextual expansion). The full manifesto is at =project/mayaloom.org=.

Three agreements:
1. *The Warp* — documents carry semantic headings, tangled code,
   named results, and a loom manifest (=#+LOOM:=, =#+DEFINES:=, etc.)
2. *The Weft* — cadenza blocks (=#+BEGIN_CADENZA=) mark expansion
   points where an agent generates contextual tutorials on demand
3. *The Fabric* — session seeds and project.org maintain continuity

This seed is for the concrete next step: annotate MāyāPramāṇa lesson
00 (Bloch equations) with MāyāLoom conventions, then test whether a
fresh session can use them.

* Current State

** MāyāPramāṇa repo
- GitHub: https://github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana
- If not already cloned: =gh repo clone mayalucia/mayapramana /tmp/mayapramana=
- Lesson 00: =lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org=
  (~800 lines, Bloch equations in Python/Haskell/C++)

** What the lesson currently has (updated 2026-02-20)
- Physics narrative (spin in a field, Bloch vector, equations of motion)
- Python implementation (BlochState, BlochParams, bloch_rhs, rk4_step)
- Haskell implementation (same types, same functions)
- C++ implementation (same)
- Cross-validation section
- Loom manifest header (LOOM, DEFINES, DEPENDS, EXPORTS, CADENZAS)
- 4 cadenza blocks with full 6-field metadata:
  1. spin-half-qm (after "A Spin in a Field")
  2. bloch-sphere-geometry (after Bloch vector intro)
  3. atomic-magnetometry (after "Why This Matters for Control")
  4. numerical-ode-methods (after RK4 integrator)

** MāyāLoom conventions (from =project/mayaloom.org=)
- Loom manifest: =#+LOOM: lesson=, =#+DEFINES:=, =#+DEPENDS:=,
  =#+EXPORTS:=, =#+CADENZAS:=
- Cadenza syntax:
  #+begin_example
  ,#+BEGIN_CADENZA
  :concept    kalman-filter
  :level      first-year-grad
  :prereqs    linear-algebra probability bloch-equations
  Explain the Kalman filter as applied to state estimation in a noisy
  magnetometer signal.
  ,#+END_CADENZA
  #+end_example

* Status: Cycle 1 Complete

Steps 1-5 below are DONE. The annotation is committed and pushed.
A fresh agent test validated the format. Three new cadenza fields
were discovered (:assumes, :anti-targets, :connects-to) and added
to all cadenzas and to the spec in mayaloom.org and conventions.org.

*What remains for future cycles*:
- Human reading pass on the annotated lesson
- Test other cadenzas (atomic-magnetometry, numerical-ode-methods)
- Annotate lesson 01 when it exists
- Codify session protocol in CLAUDE.md

* What Was Done (for reference)

1. *Add loom manifest* to the top of lesson 00:
   - =#+LOOM: lesson=
   - =#+DEFINES:= (BlochState, BlochParams, bloch_rhs, rk4_step, ...)
   - =#+DEPENDS:= (none — this is lesson 00)
   - =#+EXPORTS:= (bloch-reference.json if it exists)
   - =#+CADENZAS:= (list the concepts that get cadenza blocks)

2. *Add 2-3 cadenza blocks* at natural expansion points. Candidates:
   - Where the Bloch equations are introduced: cadenza on "spin-half
     quantum mechanics" for a student who knows classical mechanics
     but not QM
   - Where RK4 integration appears: cadenza on "numerical ODE methods"
     for a student who knows calculus but not numerical methods
   - Where cross-validation is discussed: cadenza on "why three
     languages" for a student wondering why not just use Python
   - Where the magnetometer application is mentioned: cadenza on
     "atomic magnetometry" for a student who knows the Bloch equations
     but not how they become a sensor

3. *Test*: start a fresh session with only MEMORY.md context. Point it
   at the annotated lesson. Ask it to:
   (a) read the loom manifest and summarise what the lesson defines
   (b) find a cadenza and generate a contextual tutorial
   (c) assess whether the surrounding context was sufficient

4. *Refine* based on what worked and what didn't.

5. *Codify*: add the conventions to mayapramana's =conventions.org=
   and update =CLAUDE.md= with the session protocol.

* Design Decisions Already Made
- Cadenzas are for students first, builder agents later
- Generated tutorials should be persistent but marked as generated
- Context scope: at minimum the surrounding section, ideally the
  whole lesson (it's ~800 lines, fits in any context window)
- Loom manifest uses org header keywords (=#+KEY: value=), not
  property drawers
