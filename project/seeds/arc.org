#+title: The Arc — How the Threads Weave Together
#+date: February 2026

* Read This First

This document explains /why/ the threads exist and how they connect.
The other seeds explain /what/ to do. Read this for orientation; read
a specific seed for action.

* The Story So Far

Vishal Sood, a theoretical physicist working alone with AI from a
basement, built MāyāLucIA — an open framework for rigorous
computational science. No lab, no grant, no cluster. The methodology:
measure, model, verify, iterate — the physicist's method, accelerated
by a machine that writes code fast but cannot smell when the physics
is wrong.

The first project was *bravli* — computational neuroscience, the
Drosophila mushroom body connectome, 293 passing tests, a verified
manuscript. This proved the methodology works.

The second was *mayajiva* — a C++ simulation of magnetic bug
navigation, validated against Python. This proved the cross-language
validation pattern works.

Then came *MāyāPramāṇa* — a universal quantum sensor controller.
Built for Dr. Saikat Ghosh at IIT Kanpur, who makes atomic
magnetometers. The first lesson implements the Bloch equations in
Python, Haskell, and C++. The manifesto draws on Dignāga (what counts
as valid cognition), Dharmakīrti (knowledge must enable effective
action), and Kabir (the weaver who distrusted scholars).

While writing MāyāPramāṇa, a connection surfaced: the same sensors
Saikat builds for quantum optics labs are now being used for brain
imaging. Optically pumped magnetometers replacing cryogenic SQUIDs
for wearable MEG. The Bloch equations in lesson 00 are the physics of
both atomic magnetometers and MRI. A universal controller is a tool
for neuroscience as much as for quantum optics. This became the
"On the Fields Within Us" section of the manifesto and the
applications.org document.

To make this visible, we built a wireframe website — SVG schematics
of the Bloch sphere, the sensor pipeline, OPMs on the scalp, the
pure core / effectful shell architecture. The next step is making it
interactive (the UQSC web interface).

While planning how to build the interactive demo with embedded
lessons, three questions converged into one: how should org documents
carry expansion points for students? How should agents read lessons?
How should sessions stay coherent? These merged into *MāyāLoom* —
named for Kabir's loom, where the warp (human-written document) and
weft (agent-generated expansion) cross to become understanding.

    │                    └── Saikat invitation becomes compelling
    │
Saikat Outreach ──── send the invitation when demo is ready
    │
    └── Saikat joins → GitHub issues → external collaboration begins
                                │
                                └── project management conventions matter
#+end_example

MāyāLoom feeds into UQSC (the lessons that appear in the interactive
site will use cadenza conventions). UQSC feeds into Saikat (the demo
makes the invitation land). Saikat feeds back into MāyāLoom (when
external collaborators join, the session protocols must actually
work).

*Update 2026-02-20*: MāyāLoom cycle 1 complete (lesson 00 annotated,
validated with fresh agent test). Interactive Bloch demo built.
Saikat invitation being rewritten with demo link. The arc is now at
the Saikat node — the outreach that tests whether this work lands
with an actual physicist building actual sensors.

* The Deeper Current

All of this is one thing: /making understanding tangible/.

The digital twin is not the goal. The understanding gained in building
it is. The website is not the goal. The moment when a first-year grad
student in Kanpur pulls a cadenza thread and the Kalman filter
unfolds in the context of /their/ sensor, /their/ notation, /their/
level — that is the goal.

MāyāLucIA's thesis: understanding emerges through creation, verified
by tests, made tangible through manifestation. MāyāLoom is the
convention that lets this happen across sessions, across minds, across
the boundary between human and machine.

Kabir would say: stop reading this and start weaving.
