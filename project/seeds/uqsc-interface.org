#+title: Seed — Interactive UQSC Web Interface
#+date: February 2026

* Context

MāyāPramāṇa is a universal quantum sensor controller built as digital
twins of quantum sensors. The first lesson (Bloch equations) exists.
A static wireframe site exists with SVG schematics. The next step is
making it interactive — a web interface where a user can control a
simulated magnetometer and see the physics respond.

This is the visual proof-of-concept for the entire MāyāPramāṇa
project. It's also what makes the invitation to Saikat concrete —
not just a manifesto, but a running demo.

* Current State

** Repository: =github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana=
** Local clone: =/tmp/mayapramana/=

** What exists (updated 2026-02-20)
- =manifesto.org= — with "On the Fields Within Us" neuroscience section
- =architecture.org= — FP grammar for sensor control
- =applications.org= — neuroscience, cardiology, ULF-MRI, diagnostics
- =conventions.org=, =CLAUDE.md= — project conventions and agent onboarding
- =lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org= — Bloch equations in Python,
  Haskell, C++, annotated with MāyāLoom (4 cadenzas, loom manifest)
- =site/index.html= — INTERACTIVE DEMO with:
  - 3D Bloch sphere (Canvas 2D projection, draggable view, spin trail)
  - Live magnetometer signal plot (Mx cyan, My blue, Mz gold)
  - Sliders: B-field (1-200 uT), T2 (1-100 ms), T1 (10-500 ms), M0 (0-1)
  - Presets: tip-90, FID, pure precession, relaxation, reset
  - RK4 integrator (same physics as lesson 00)
  - Sensor pipeline SVG, application cards, trilingual code columns
  - Self-contained: single HTML file, no dependencies, no build step

** Old wireframe (superseded)
=invitations/mayapramana-site-wireframe.html= (static version, kept for reference)

* Status: Bloch Demo Complete

Steps 1 and 2 are DONE. Vanilla JS + Canvas 2D, single HTML file.
Technical decisions resolved: no frameworks, no build step, orthographic
projection for 3D.

* Next Steps (future sessions)

1. [DONE] *Interactive Bloch sphere* — Canvas 2D projection, draggable,
   spin trail, presets. RK4 integrator in JS.

2. [DONE] *Physics engine in browser* — vanilla JS, same equations as
   lesson 00. Decision: JS for simplicity, WASM later if needed.

3. *Kalman filter visualisation* — add a noisy measurement stream,
   show the Kalman filter tracking the true state. Controls for noise
   level, measurement rate.

4. *Feedback loop demo* — PID controller holding lock on a drifting
   field. Show what happens when bandwidth is too low, gain too high.

5. *Deploy to GitHub Pages* — from the mayapramana repo. Enable Pages
   on the =site/= directory.
