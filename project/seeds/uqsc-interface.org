#+title: Seed — Interactive UQSC Web Interface
#+date: February 2026

* Context

MāyāPramāṇa is a universal quantum sensor controller built as digital
twins of quantum sensors. The first lesson (Bloch equations) exists.
A static wireframe site exists with SVG schematics. The next step is
making it interactive — a web interface where a user can control a
simulated magnetometer and see the physics respond.

This is the visual proof-of-concept for the entire MāyāPramāṇa
project. It's also what makes the invitation to Saikat concrete —
not just a manifesto, but a running demo.

* Current State

** Repository: =github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana=
** Local clone: =/tmp/mayapramana/=

** What exists
- =manifesto.org= — with "On the Fields Within Us" neuroscience section
- =architecture.org= — FP grammar for sensor control
- =applications.org= — neuroscience, cardiology, ULF-MRI, diagnostics
- =conventions.org=, =CLAUDE.md= — project conventions and agent onboarding
- =lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org= — Bloch equations in Python, Haskell, C++
- =site/index.html= — wireframe with:
  - Fig 1: sensor pipeline (SVG)
  - Fig 2: Bloch sphere with precession/relaxation (SVG)
  - Fig 3: OPM-on-scalp neuroscience schematic (SVG)
  - Fig 4: pure core / effectful shell architecture (SVG)
  - Trilingual code preview (Python, Haskell, C++)
  - Application cards (MEG, NV-diamond, ULF-MRI, MCG, diagnostics, quantum optics)
  - One remaining placeholder: verified manuscript badge preview

The wireframe is also at:
=invitations/mayapramana-site-wireframe.html= (in the root mayalucia repo)

* Next Steps

1. *Interactive Bloch sphere* — SVG or Canvas animation of spin
   precessing in real time. Controls for B field (magnitude + direction),
   T1, T2. Show trajectory on the sphere.

2. *Physics engine in browser* — options:
   - Pyodide (Python in WASM) — uses the existing Python implementation
   - Hand-rolled JS — simple enough for RK4 + Bloch equations
   - C++ → WASM via Emscripten — matches the deployment target
   Recommendation: start with JS for speed, port to WASM later.

3. *Kalman filter visualisation* — add a noisy measurement stream,
   show the Kalman filter tracking the true state. Controls for noise
   level, measurement rate.

4. *Feedback loop demo* — PID controller holding lock on a drifting
   field. Show what happens when bandwidth is too low, gain too high.

5. *Polish and deploy* — GitHub Pages from the mayapramana repo.
   This is what the invitation to Saikat links to.

* Technical Decisions Needed

- JS vs Pyodide vs WASM for the physics core
- Canvas vs SVG for the animated Bloch sphere
- Whether to use any JS library (Three.js for 3D?) or stay pure
- How to structure the code (single HTML? modular JS files?)
