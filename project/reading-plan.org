/Pothi padhi padhi jag mua, pandit bhaya na koye/
/Dhai akhar prem ka, padhe so pandit hoye/

Reading books, the whole world died, none became wise.
Two and a half letters of Love --- whoever reads them becomes wise.

There are ~240 files in this organisation. You do not need to read
them all. Most are session logs, archives, and intermediate artifacts.
The substance lives in about 30 files. This plan identifies them,
groups them by intent, and suggests an order.

*Time estimate*: A focused reading pass takes 3--4 sessions of ~1 hour
each. You are not reading to consume --- you are reading to judge,
mark up, rewrite, and inhabit.

* Pass 1: The Spine (what this project /is/)
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: 1 hour
:END:

Read these in order. They are the load-bearing documents. If anything
here doesn't sound like you, rewrite it --- these are the documents
any collaborator (human or machine) reads first.

| # | File | Lines | Read for |
|---+------+-------+----------|
| 1 | =mayalucia.org= | 155 | The vision. Does this still say what you mean? |
| 2 | =manifesto.org= | 274 | The public-facing manifesto. Tone, claims, scope. |
| 3 | =CLAUDE.md= | 81 | Instructions to every AI agent. Are they right? |
| 4 | =project/mayaloom.org= | 301 | The MayaLoom convention. Does the weaving metaphor hold? |
| 5 | =project/project.org= | 258 | Thread tracker. Is it current? |
| 6 | =project/modular.org= | 144 | The 8-module architecture. Still the right decomposition? |

*After this pass*: you know whether the project's self-description
matches your intent. Mark up anything that doesn't fit.

* Pass 2: MayaPramana (the active frontier)
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: 1 hour
:END:

This is where the MayaLoom convention was just tested. It's fresh,
it's small, and it's the piece you might share with Saikat.

| # | File | Lines | Read for |
|---+------+-------+----------|
| 1 | =/tmp/mayapramana/manifesto.org= | 459 | Voice, accuracy, the neuroscience section |
| 2 | =/tmp/mayapramana/architecture.org= | 480 | FP grammar, monadic composition --- is this the right framing for Saikat? |
| 3 | =/tmp/mayapramana/applications.org= | 288 | Completeness, emphasis, anything wrong or missing? |
| 4 | =/tmp/mayapramana/conventions.org= | 551 | Skim the old parts, read the new MayaLoom section carefully |
| 5 | =/tmp/mayapramana/lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org= | 885 | *The most important file.* Read it as a physicist, not as a project manager. Is the physics right? Is the pedagogy right? Are the cadenzas at the right seams? |
| 6 | =invitations/saikat-ghosh.org= | 153 | Would you send this? |

*After this pass*: you know whether MayaPramana is presentable to
Saikat, and what needs rewriting before you send it.

* Pass 3: The Established Work (what's already solid)
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: 45 minutes
:END:

Bravli has 293 passing tests and a verified manuscript. MayaJiva has
23 passing tests. These are done work --- read to remember what you
have, not to judge.

** Bravli (neuroscience toolkit)

| # | File | Lines | Read for |
|---+------+-------+----------|
| 1 | =bravli/bravli.org= | 125 | Overview --- refresh your memory |
| 2 | =bravli/code/bravli/codev/00-foundations.org= | 801 | The literate pattern at its most mature |
| 3 | =bravli/code/bravli/codev/05-explore-mushroom-body.org= | 622 | The science --- does it still excite you? |
| 4 | =bravli/code/bravli/manuscripts/mb-dynamics/paper.org= | 565 | The manuscript. Is it publishable? |

** MayaJiva (magnetic bugs)

| # | File | Lines | Read for |
|---+------+-------+----------|
| 1 | =experment/magnetic-bugs/magnetic-navigation.org= | 1399 | The original literate experiment |
| 2 | =experment/magnetic-bugs/paper.org= | 976 | The computational story |

** MayaPortal (rendering kernel)

| # | File | Lines | Read for |
|---+------+-------+----------|
| 1 | =modules/mayaportal/mayaportal.org= | 376 | Architecture and intent |
| 2 | =modules/mayaportal/codev/00-prelude.org= | 242 | The C++23 literate style |

*After this pass*: you have a clear picture of what's built, what's
publishable, and what connects to what.

* Pass 4: The Periphery (skim or skip)
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: 30 minutes, or skip entirely
:END:

These exist and have value, but are not urgent. Skim headings only.
Return to specific files when a thread needs them.

** Worth skimming

- =collab/scientific-understanding.org= (434 lines) --- deep
  reflection, may want to revisit
- =develop/guiding-philosophy.org= (62 lines) --- short, check if
  current
- =parbati/parbati.org= (72 lines) --- the Himalaya thread, parked
  but alive
- =agency/mayalucia-agency.org= (272 lines) --- agent roles, may
  inform MayaLoom

** Skip for now

- =collab/llm-queries/= --- archive of past LLM conversations (~6000
  lines). Useful for archaeology, not for reading.
- =collab/sessions/= --- ~40 session logs from architecture and
  development discussions. These informed the current state; the
  current state is what matters.
- =.agent-shell/transcripts/= --- raw session transcripts (~164k
  lines). Reference only.
- =modules/mayaportal/collab/sessions/phase-1/= --- detailed
  implementation logs. Return only if resuming MayaPortal work.
- =agency/development-guides/gptel-guide/= --- Emacs gptel setup
  guides. Operational, not conceptual.

* How to Read

You work in Emacs. So:

1. Open the file in org-mode
2. Read at your pace --- fold/unfold sections as needed
3. *Mark up as you go*: add =TODO= and =FIXME= tags, inline comments
   (lines starting with =# =), or property drawers with
   =:VERDICT: rewrite= / =:VERDICT: good= / =:VERDICT: cut=
4. When something is wrong, fix it in place --- don't make a note to
   fix it later. The org file is the source of truth; if it's wrong,
   it should be fixed now.
5. When something is missing from your own understanding, add a
   cadenza block --- this is what they're for.

* What "Done" Looks Like

After the reading plan:

- The spine documents (Pass 1) sound like you
- MayaPramana (Pass 2) is either ready to share with Saikat or has
  a clear list of what needs rewriting
- You know what you've built (Pass 3) and what connects to what
- You can confidently say: "I have read this. This is mine."

Only then does dissemination make sense.
