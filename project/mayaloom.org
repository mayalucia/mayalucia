/Jheeni jheeni beeni chadariya/
/Kahe ka tana, kahe ki bharni/
/Kaun tar se beeni chadariya/

Finely, finely woven is this shawl —
What is its warp, what is its weft?
With what thread was this shawl woven?
--- Kabir
#+end_quote

Kabir was a weaver. Not a metaphorical weaver, not a spiritual weaver who happened to use the loom as an image. A weaver. His hands knew the shuttle before his tongue knew the verses. He sat at the loom in Varanasi and worked cotton into cloth while the pandits around him worked Sanskrit into commentary.

He distrusted the pandits. /Pothi padhi padhi jag mua, pandit bhaya na koye/ — reading books, the whole world died, none became wise. He distrusted the mullahs equally. He distrusted anyone who confused knowing-about with knowing-how, anyone who could recite the text but not thread the needle.

What Kabir trusted was the loom. The tānā (warp) is set up once — fixed, structural, the skeleton of the cloth. The bānā (weft) is passed through by hand — each pass a choice, each row a new line. The cloth emerges from the crossing of two threads that are individually nothing. Neither warp nor weft is fabric. Only their meeting is.

We build MāyāLoom in this spirit.

A scientist writes an org file — a lesson on spin dynamics, a manifesto on measurement, a plan for a sensor controller. This is the tānā: the warp thread, set up with care, carrying the structure of understanding.

An AI agent reads that file and weaves through it — expanding a concept here, generating a tutorial there, implementing a function, testing a claim, answering a student's question in the context of /this/ lesson, /this/ notation, /this/ level of understanding. This is the bānā: the weft thread, different each time, for each reader, making different cloth from the same loom.

Neither thread alone is understanding. The org file without a reader is inert. The agent without the org file hallucinates. Understanding emerges at the crossing — where the structure of the document meets the generative capacity of the mind reading it.

Kabir would ask: what are you weaving, and for whom?

We are weaving knowledge. And the cloth is for anyone who will wear it.

* What MāyāLoom Is

MāyāLoom is a convention — a way of writing org documents so that they serve as looms on which both human and machine minds can weave.

It is not a tool. It is not a platform. It is a set of agreements about how to mark the warp threads so that the weft can pass through cleanly.

Three agreements:

** The Warp: Documents with Structure

An org file that follows the MāyāLoom convention carries:

- *Headings* that are semantic (not just organisational) — a heading named =** The Bloch Equations= tells any reader, human or machine, what this section /is about/
  
- *Code blocks* that are tangled implementations of the ideas in the prose — the code is not an appendix, it is a restatement of the physics in a different language
  
- *Named results* that serve as test expectations — if the simulation produces this number, the implementation is correct
  
- *Metadata* that tells a machine reader what this document defines, what it depends on, and what it exports

This is already how good literate programs are written. MāyāLoom adds one thing: the explicit declaration that /this document is intended to be read by machines as well as humans/, and here is what they should look for.

** The Weft: Expansion Points

At certain places in the warp, the weaver has left deliberate gaps — places where the thread of the narrative passes over a concept without fully developing it. In a traditional text, these would be footnotes, or references, or simply lacunae that the reader must fill from their own knowledge.

In a MāyāLoom document, these are *cadenzas* — marked points where an agent can generate contextual expansion:

#+begin_example
,#+BEGIN_CADENZA
:concept    kalman-filter
:knows      linear-algebra probability
:needs      state-estimation sensor-fusion
:prereqs    linear-algebra probability
:assumes    bloch-equations larmor-frequency
:anti-targets    quantum-computing bayesian-deep-learning
:connects-to     pid-control feedback-loops
Explain the Kalman filter as applied to state estimation in a noisy
magnetometer signal. Connect to the Bloch equations developed above.
,#+END_CADENZA
#+end_example

*** Cadenza Fields

| Field         | Required | Meaning                                                      |
|---------------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| =:concept=      | yes      | Slug identifying this cadenza (matches =#+CADENZAS:= list)     |
| =:knows=        | yes      | Domains/concepts the reader already commands                 |
| =:needs=        | yes      | Domains/concepts this cadenza bridges toward                 |
| =:prereqs=      | yes      | What the reader should know but may need reminding of        |
| =:assumes=      | no       | What this lesson has already taught — do not re-explain      |
| =:anti-targets= | no       | Topics to explicitly /not/ cover (prevents wandering)          |
| =:connects-to=  | no       | Forward references to later sections or cadenzas             |

The =:knows= / =:needs= pair replaces a vertical "level" scale. A collaborator who knows control theory but needs atomic physics is not "lower" than one who knows both — they are /lateral/, crossing a domain gap. The cadenza bridges that gap.

The prose body after the metadata is a structured prompt: it tells the expanding agent what to explain, from what starting point, for what kind of reader, connecting to what notation.

*Validated 2026-02-20*: A fresh agent with no MāyāLoom context was given lesson 00 and a student question. It parsed the manifest, found the =bloch-sphere-geometry= cadenza, read =:knows=, =:needs=, and =:prereqs=, used surrounding lesson context to avoid repetition, and generated a 100-line tutorial pitched correctly. The convention works without any special framework — the org file is the interface.

The cadenza block is simultaneously:

- *For a human reader*: a signpost — "if you need to understand Kalman filtering, this is where to ask"
  
- *For a guide agent*: a structured prompt with metadata — role, level, prerequisites, context scope
  
- *For a builder agent*: a specification of what capability is needed at this point in the pipeline
  
- *For a student with an AI tutor*: the exact prompt to send, already framed in the context of the lesson

The word /cadenza/ comes from music — a passage where the performer improvises within the harmonic structure set by the composer. The lesson is the composition. The agent improvises the cadenza. The structure holds.

But remember Kabir: the cadenza is not the cloth. The cloth is what the student understands afterward.

** The Fabric: Session Continuity

The third agreement is about time. A weaver does not finish the cloth in one sitting. They leave the loom with the warp tensioned and the shuttle resting at the last row. The next morning — or the next weaver — picks up where the thread left off.

MāyāLoom documents carry their state:

- *Project tracker* (=project.org=): what threads are active, parked, complete. Any session reads this first.
  
- *Session seeds* (=seeds/*.org=): enough context to resume a specific thread. A seed is the shuttle left at the last row.
  
- *Memory files* (=MEMORY.md=): what an AI agent needs to know that isn't in any single document — the accumulated decisions, the conventions, the gotchas.

The convention is: when you leave the loom, leave it so the next weaver can sit down and start immediately. Update the seed. Note where you stopped. Say what's next.

This is not project management. This is tānā-bānā — keeping the tension in the threads so the cloth doesn't unravel between sessions.

* The Loom Manifest

Every MāyāLoom document carries a header that tells machine readers what the loom holds:

#+begin_example
,#+LOOM:     lesson
,#+TITLE:    Lesson 00 — The Bloch Equations
,#+DEFINES:  BlochState BlochParams bloch_rhs rk4_step
,#+DEPENDS:  (none)
,#+EXPORTS:  bloch-reference.json
,#+CADENZAS: kalman-filter optical-pumping noise-models
#+end_example

- =#+LOOM:= declares the document type (=lesson=, =plan=, =seed=, =manifesto=).
- =#+DEFINES:= lists concepts and functions this document introduces.
- =#+DEPENDS:= lists what the reader must already know (other lessons, external prerequisites).
- =#+EXPORTS:= names artifacts produced (reference data, tangled code).
- =#+CADENZAS:= lists the expansion points available, so an agent can discover them without scanning the full text.

Within each cadenza block, the metadata fields (=:concept=, =:knows=, =:needs=, =:prereqs=, =:assumes=, =:anti-targets=, =:connects-to=) give an expanding agent everything it needs to generate a contextual tutorial without any framework — just the org file.

This is the warp laid out on the loom: here is the shape of what will be woven.

* Reading Conventions

Any collaborator — human or machine — encountering a MāyāLoom document should:

1. *Read the manifest* — the =#+LOOM:= header block tells you what this document is and what it defines.

2. *Follow the headings* — depth-1 headings (=*=) are major sections. Depth-2 headings (=**=) are the semantic units — each one is about one concept, one function, one idea.

3. *Respect the tangle* — code blocks with =:tangle= headers are reference implementations. They are not examples or illustrations. They are the /canonical/ expression of the concept in that language.

4. *Find the cadenzas* — =#+BEGIN_CADENZA= blocks are invitations to expand. Read the metadata. If the reader (student or agent) needs the concept, expand it. If not, pass over.

5. *Check named results* — =#+NAME:= and =#+RESULTS:= blocks are test expectations. An implementation that produces different numbers is wrong.

6. *Carry the context* — when expanding a cadenza, include the surrounding section (at minimum) as context. The expansion should use the same notation, the same variable names, the same physical system as the host lesson.

* For Kabir

#+begin_quote
/Dhai akhar prem ka, padhe so pandit hoye/

Two and a half letters of Love — whoever reads them becomes wise.
--- Kabir
#+end_quote

All these conventions, all these metadata headers and cadenza blocks
and session protocols — Kabir would look at them and laugh. Too many
words. Too much machinery. The whole world died reading books.

He is right.

The conventions exist so that the weaving can happen without friction. The moment the weaving is happening — the moment a student is working through the Bloch equations with an AI tutor, and the tutor knows exactly where in the lesson the student is stuck, and generates exactly the explanation needed, using exactly the notation from the lesson, and the student /understands/ — in that moment, the conventions are invisible. The loom disappears. Only the cloth remains.

That is the test.

Not: does the cadenza syntax parse correctly?
Not: did the agent read the manifest?
Not: is the session seed up to date?

But: did someone understand something they didn't understand before?

/Arthakriyāsāmarthya./ The capacity for effective action. Dharmakīrti's test, expressed in Kabir's vocabulary: can you weave the cloth, or can you only describe the loom?

#+begin_quote
/Chalti chakki dekh kar, diya Kabira roye/
/Do paatan ke beech mein, saabut bacha na koye/

Watching the grinding stones turn, Kabir wept —
Between the two stones, nothing survives whole.
--- Kabir
#+end_quote

Between the human mind and the machine mind, the old way of knowing does not survive whole. Something new is being ground. We do not yet know what flour it will make.

But we have a loom. And we have thread.

Let us weave.
