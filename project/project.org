#+todo: ACTIVE PARKED | DONE DROPPED

This is the living project tracker for MāyāLucIA. Any session — human or agent — should read this file to understand what is active, what is parked, and where to resume.

For agent sessions: this file + CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md gives you full context. Read all three before starting work.

* Organisation

MāyāLucIA is a personal research framework for scientific understanding through computational creation. It is organised as a GitHub org ([[https://github.com/mayalucia]]) with modular repos. This root repo is the headquarters — organisational documents, not code.

:PROPERTIES:
:REPO:     github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana
:LOCAL:    /tmp/mayapramana/
:SEED:     [[file:seeds/uqsc-interface.org]]
:END:

Build an interactive web interface to the digital twin of a quantum
sensor. Bloch sphere with controls, Kalman filter visualisation,
feedback loop dashboard.

*State*: Interactive demo built and pushed. =site/index.html= has:
- 3D Bloch sphere (Canvas, draggable, spin trail)
- Live magnetometer signal plot (Mx, My, Mz)
- Sliders: B-field, T1, T2, M0 (optical pumping)
- Presets: tip-90, FID, pure precession, relaxation
- RK4 integrator (same physics as lesson 00)
- Sensor pipeline SVG, application cards, trilingual code preview

*Done so far*:
- manifesto.org (with neuroscience section "On the Fields Within Us")
- architecture.org, conventions.org, CLAUDE.md
- applications.org (neuroscience, cardiology, ULF-MRI, point-of-care)
- lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org (Python, Haskell, C++)
  + MāyāLoom annotations: loom manifest + 4 cadenzas (validated)
- site/index.html — interactive demo (committed, pushed)

*Next*: deploy to GitHub Pages. Add Kalman filter and feedback loop
panels (future sessions). Awaiting human reading pass on lesson 00.

:END:

Tānā-Bānā: org files as looms for human-machine understanding.
Cadenza blocks for expansion points, loom manifests for agent
discovery, session protocols for continuity across sessions.

*State*: DONE for this cycle. Manifesto written, conventions codified,
lesson 00 annotated, fresh-session test passed.

*What was delivered*:
- =project/mayaloom.org= — manifesto with validated cadenza spec
- Lesson 00 annotated with loom manifest + 4 cadenzas (6 fields each)
- Fresh agent test: parsed manifest, found cadenza, generated 100-line
  tutorial pitched correctly. Convention works without any framework.
- =conventions.org= in mayapramana updated with MāyāLoom section
- Three new cadenza fields from testing: =:assumes=, =:anti-targets=,
  =:connects-to=

*Next*: human reading pass on the conventions and annotated lesson.
Further cadenza testing in future sessions.

** PARKED Parbati: Himalaya Digital Twin                       :parbati:

Digital twin of Parvati Valley. Dormant — waiting for rendering
infrastructure (mayaportal) and methodology (agency framework).

** PARKED Epistemological Convergence                              :meta:

The deeper question: org files serving simultaneously as science,
agent instructions, project state, and verified claims. Think about,

* Conventions

** Session Seeds

A session seed is a short org document in =project/seeds/= that gives
a new agent session enough context to resume a thread. Structure:

#+begin_example
#+title: Seed — [Thread Name]
* Context
  What this thread is about, what has been done.
* Current State
  Pointers to files, repos, open questions.
* Next Steps
  Concrete actions, in priority order.
* References
  Links to relevant docs (manifesto, architecture, agency specs).
#+end_example

** Periodic Convergence

At least once per multi-session work burst, review this file:
- Mark completed threads DONE
- Update state descriptions
- Prune seeds that are stale
- Add new threads discovered during work

** Decision Log

Major decisions go in =project/decisions.org= (create when first
needed). Format:

#+begin_example
* YYYY-MM-DD: [Decision Title]
  - Context: why this came up
  - Options considered
  - Chosen: which and why
  - Consequences: what this implies
#+end_example

* Session Log

** 2026-02-20 (session 2): MāyāLoom validation, interactive demo, Saikat rewrite
:PROPERTIES:
:SESSION:  Claude Code (Opus 4.6)
:DURATION: ~1.5 hours
:END:

Continued from session 1 (same day), which ran out of context.

*What was done:*

1. *Completed MāyāLoom annotation of lesson 00* — added remaining 2
   cadenzas (numerical-ode-methods, atomic-magnetometry). All 4
   cadenzas upgraded with 3 new fields (:assumes, :anti-targets,
   :connects-to).

2. *Validated MāyāLoom with fresh agent test* — a fresh agent with no
   MāyāLoom context parsed the loom manifest, found the
   bloch-sphere-geometry cadenza, read :level and :prereqs, used
   surrounding context, generated a 100-line tutorial pitched
   correctly. The agent also suggested 3 new cadenza fields.

3. *Codified MāyāLoom conventions* — updated project/mayaloom.org
   with field reference table and validation note. Added MāyāLoom
   section to mayapramana's conventions.org.

4. *Built interactive UQSC demo* — site/index.html in mayapramana:
   3D Bloch sphere (Canvas, draggable), live signal plot, sliders for
   B/T1/T2/M0, preset buttons, RK4 integrator. Self-contained HTML,
   no dependencies.

5. *Reading plan* — project/reading-plan.org: 4-pass plan for human
   review of ~30 substantive files out of ~240 total.

6. *Updated project docs* — project.org thread states, seeds table,
   session log.

7. *Rewrote invitation to Saikat* — now includes link to interactive
   demo.

*Decisions made:*
- Interactive demo: vanilla JS + Canvas, no frameworks (single HTML)
- Cadenza fields expanded from 3 to 6 based on agent test feedback
- Dissemination deferred until human reading pass complete
- Reading plan: 4 passes, ~3-4 hours total

** 2026-02-20: MāyāPramāṇa applications, MāyāLoom, project infrastructure
:PROPERTIES:
:SESSION:  Claude Code (Opus 4.6)
:DURATION: ~3 hours
:END:

This session continued from a previous one that had exhausted its
context window. The previous session (2026-02-19/20) built the
MāyāPramāṇa repo: manifesto, architecture, conventions, CLAUDE.md,
lesson 00 (Bloch equations), and the invitation to Saikat.

*What was done:*

1. *Manifesto neuroscience section* — added "On the Fields Within Us"
   to mayapramana's manifesto.org. The EM-fields-in-the-brain
   argument: OPMs replacing SQUIDs for MEG, same Bloch equations,
   same Fisher information, same Kalman filters.

2. *applications.org* — detailed survey of quantum magnetometry
   applications: wearable MEG, single-neuron NV-diamond, ULF-MRI,
   magnetocardiography, biomagnetism, point-of-care diagnostics,
   the pedagogical dimension. Committed and pushed to mayapramana.

3. *Saikat invitation rewrite* — invitations/saikat-ghosh.org now
   leads with MāyāPramāṇa, the EM-fields connection, applications.org.
   Both .org and .md versions updated.

4. *Wireframe website* — site/index.html in mayapramana with:
   - SVG Fig 1: sensor pipeline (pratyaksa → anumana with feedback)
   - SVG Fig 2: Bloch sphere (precession, T1, T2, external field B)
   - SVG Fig 3: OPM-on-scalp (pyramidal neurons, field lines, sensors)
   - SVG Fig 4: pure core / effectful shell architecture
   - Trilingual code preview (Python, Haskell, C++ Bloch RHS)
   - Application cards (6 domains)

5. *Thread convergence* — three threads (embedded prompts, agent-
   readable lessons, project management) merged into one: MāyāLoom.

6. *MāyāLoom manifesto* — project/mayaloom.org. Named for Kabir's
   loom. Tānā (warp, the document) and bānā (weft, the agent's
   expansion). Cadenza blocks, loom manifests, session protocols.

7. *Project infrastructure* — project.org as master tracker, 8 session
   seeds including arc.org (the story connecting all threads).

8. *GitHub repo fix* — root repo remote was pointing at mayajiva.
   Created mayalucia/mayalucia repo. Reverted accidental push to
   mayajiva. All repos now clean.

*Decisions made:*
- Root repo is the organisation HQ (option A from the discussion)
- Three threads merged into MāyāLoom (not run as separate sessions)
- Cadenza blocks use =#+BEGIN_CADENZA= syntax with :concept, :level, :prereqs
- Loom manifest uses org header keywords (=#+LOOM:=, =#+DEFINES:=, etc.)
- Generated tutorials: persistent but marked as generated
- Name "MāyāLoom" chosen over "Literate Agency", "MāyāSūtra", "Score"

*What is next:*
- Annotate lesson 00 with cadenzas + loom manifest (seed: mayaloom.org)
- Build interactive UQSC web interface (seed: uqsc-interface.org)
- Send Saikat invitation when site is demo-worthy
