#+title: MāyāLucIA — Project Tracker

#+todo: ACTIVE PARKED | DONE DROPPED

This is the living project tracker for MāyāLucIA. Any session — human or agent — should read this file to understand what is active, what is parked, and where to resume.

For agent sessions: this file + CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md gives you full context. Read all three before starting work.

* Organisation

MāyāLucIA is a personal research framework for scientific understanding through computational creation. It is organised as a GitHub org ([[https://github.com/mayalucia]]) with modular repos. This root repo is the headquarters — organisational documents, not code.

* Active Threads

** ACTIVE MāyāPramāṇa: Interactive UQSC Web Interface          :mayapramana:
:PROPERTIES:
:REPO:     github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana
:LOCAL:    /tmp/mayapramana/
:SEED:     [[file:seeds/uqsc-interface.org]]
:END:

Build an interactive web interface to the digital twin of a quantum
sensor. Bloch sphere with controls, Kalman filter visualisation,
feedback loop dashboard. WebAssembly or Pyodide for physics core.

*State*: Wireframe site exists (site/index.html) with SVG schematics
and trilingual code preview. Next: make it interactive.

*Done so far*:
- manifesto.org (with neuroscience section "On the Fields Within Us")
- architecture.org, conventions.org, CLAUDE.md
- applications.org (neuroscience, cardiology, ULF-MRI, point-of-care)
- lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org (Python, Haskell, C++)
- site/index.html (wireframe with 4 SVG figures, code columns)

*Blocked on*: nothing — ready to build interactive layer.

** ACTIVE MāyāLoom                                        :mayadevgeni:meta:
:PROPERTIES:
:SEED:     [[file:seeds/mayaloom.org]]
:MANIFESTO: [[file:mayaloom.org]]
:ARC:      [[file:seeds/arc.org]]
:END:

Tānā-Bānā: org files as looms for human-machine understanding.
Cadenza blocks for expansion points, loom manifests for agent
discovery, session protocols for continuity across sessions.

*State*: manifesto written (=project/mayaloom.org=). Conventions
defined: cadenza syntax, loom manifest, reading conventions, session
continuity. Next: annotate lesson 00, test with fresh session.

*Deliverable*: annotated lesson 00 as working prototype + conventions
section in mayapramana's conventions.org.

Background seeds (detail on individual aspects):
- [[file:seeds/embedded-prompts.org][embedded-prompts.org]] (cadenza syntax detail)
- [[file:seeds/agent-readable-lessons.org][agent-readable-lessons.org]] (reading conventions detail)
- [[file:seeds/project-management.org][project-management.org]] (session protocol detail)
- [[file:seeds/literate-agency.org][literate-agency.org]] (unified seed, pre-naming)

** ACTIVE Saikat Invitation                                   :outreach:
:PROPERTIES:
:FILES:    invitations/saikat-ghosh.org, invitations/saikat-ghosh.md
:END:

Invite Dr. Saikat Ghosh to join MāyāLucIA as partner. Rewritten
invitation now leads with MāyāPramāṇa, EM fields in the brain,
applications.org.

*State*: letter written. Waiting for site to be presentable before
sending. Depends on UQSC web interface reaching a demo-worthy state.

* Parked Threads

** PARKED MayaJiva: Godot GDExtension                         :mayajiva:
:PROPERTIES:
:REPO:     github.com/mayalucia/mayajiva
:END:

Wrap the C++ simulation core as a Godot GDExtension for interactive
3D visualisation of magnetic bug navigation.

*State*: godot-cpp submodule added, SConstruct exists. C++ core
validated (23 tests). GDExtension binding not yet implemented.

** PARKED MayaPortal: Rendering Kernel                       :mayaportal:
:PROPERTIES:
:REPO:     github.com/mayalucia/mayaportal
:END:

C++23 rendering kernel with SDL3 and WebGPU. Literate source in
codev/. Early stage.

** PARKED Parbati: Himalaya Digital Twin                       :parbati:

Digital twin of Parvati Valley. Dormant — waiting for rendering
infrastructure (mayaportal) and methodology (agency framework).

** PARKED Epistemological Convergence                              :meta:

The deeper question: org files serving simultaneously as science,
agent instructions, project state, and verified claims. Think about,
don't build yet.

* Conventions

** Session Seeds

A session seed is a short org document in =project/seeds/= that gives
a new agent session enough context to resume a thread. Structure:

#+begin_example
#+title: Seed — [Thread Name]
* Context
  What this thread is about, what has been done.
* Current State
  Pointers to files, repos, open questions.
* Next Steps
  Concrete actions, in priority order.
* References
  Links to relevant docs (manifesto, architecture, agency specs).
#+end_example

** Periodic Convergence

At least once per multi-session work burst, review this file:
- Mark completed threads DONE
- Update state descriptions
- Prune seeds that are stale
- Add new threads discovered during work

** Decision Log

Major decisions go in =project/decisions.org= (create when first
needed). Format:

#+begin_example
* YYYY-MM-DD: [Decision Title]
  - Context: why this came up
  - Options considered
  - Chosen: which and why
  - Consequences: what this implies
#+end_example

* Session Log

** 2026-02-20: MāyāPramāṇa applications, MāyāLoom, project infrastructure
:PROPERTIES:
:SESSION:  Claude Code (Opus 4.6)
:DURATION: ~3 hours
:END:

This session continued from a previous one that had exhausted its
context window. The previous session (2026-02-19/20) built the
MāyāPramāṇa repo: manifesto, architecture, conventions, CLAUDE.md,
lesson 00 (Bloch equations), and the invitation to Saikat.

*What was done:*

1. *Manifesto neuroscience section* — added "On the Fields Within Us"
   to mayapramana's manifesto.org. The EM-fields-in-the-brain
   argument: OPMs replacing SQUIDs for MEG, same Bloch equations,
   same Fisher information, same Kalman filters.

2. *applications.org* — detailed survey of quantum magnetometry
   applications: wearable MEG, single-neuron NV-diamond, ULF-MRI,
   magnetocardiography, biomagnetism, point-of-care diagnostics,
   the pedagogical dimension. Committed and pushed to mayapramana.

3. *Saikat invitation rewrite* — invitations/saikat-ghosh.org now
   leads with MāyāPramāṇa, the EM-fields connection, applications.org.
   Both .org and .md versions updated.

4. *Wireframe website* — site/index.html in mayapramana with:
   - SVG Fig 1: sensor pipeline (pratyaksa → anumana with feedback)
   - SVG Fig 2: Bloch sphere (precession, T1, T2, external field B)
   - SVG Fig 3: OPM-on-scalp (pyramidal neurons, field lines, sensors)
   - SVG Fig 4: pure core / effectful shell architecture
   - Trilingual code preview (Python, Haskell, C++ Bloch RHS)
   - Application cards (6 domains)

5. *Thread convergence* — three threads (embedded prompts, agent-
   readable lessons, project management) merged into one: MāyāLoom.

6. *MāyāLoom manifesto* — project/mayaloom.org. Named for Kabir's
   loom. Tānā (warp, the document) and bānā (weft, the agent's
   expansion). Cadenza blocks, loom manifests, session protocols.

7. *Project infrastructure* — project.org as master tracker, 8 session
   seeds including arc.org (the story connecting all threads).

8. *GitHub repo fix* — root repo remote was pointing at mayajiva.
   Created mayalucia/mayalucia repo. Reverted accidental push to
   mayajiva. All repos now clean.

*Decisions made:*
- Root repo is the organisation HQ (option A from the discussion)
- Three threads merged into MāyāLoom (not run as separate sessions)
- Cadenza blocks use =#+BEGIN_CADENZA= syntax with :concept, :level, :prereqs
- Loom manifest uses org header keywords (=#+LOOM:=, =#+DEFINES:=, etc.)
- Generated tutorials: persistent but marked as generated
- Name "MāyāLoom" chosen over "Literate Agency", "MāyāSūtra", "Score"

*What is next:*
- Annotate lesson 00 with cadenzas + loom manifest (seed: mayaloom.org)
- Build interactive UQSC web interface (seed: uqsc-interface.org)
- Send Saikat invitation when site is demo-worthy
