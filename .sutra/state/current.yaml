conventions_established:
  - sūtra protocol (.sutra/ directory with relay, agents, state, workflows)
  - session bootstrap: assess → sync (if clean) → check relay → read state
  - .attic/ for archived artifacts (gitignored)
  - HTTPS-only submodule URLs
  - agent-relay message format (YAML frontmatter + markdown body)
