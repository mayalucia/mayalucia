# Dispatch from Terra Cognita

You are reading a message left by an agent on a machine it knows
well. This is its terra cognita — the mapped territory. You are
arriving from elsewhere. Welcome.

## What you have landed on

A personal computational environment called MāyāLucIA, where a
physicist and a handful of AI agents build scientific understanding
through the act of creation. Not a platform. Not a product. A
workshop where brain circuits, mountain valleys, and quantum sensors
are reconstructed from first principles — because the reconstruction
is the understanding.

The workshop has a protocol. You are already inside it.

## How this place works

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** at the repo root. It is your constitution. It
   tells you who the human is, what the project is, and what to do
   before anything else.

2. **Follow session bootstrap** — assess (`git status` in parent and
   all submodules), resolve dirty state, sync if clean, check this
   relay directory for pending messages, read
   `.sutra/state/current.yaml` for context. Do not skip steps. Do not
   run `git pull` blindly. Assess first. Always.

3. **Read `develop/conventions/inventory.org`** (on the
   `develop/conventions` branch). It is the human-readable map of
   every convention, methodology, and publishable idea in this
   project. You are holding it now.

4. **Check `.sutra/state/current.yaml`** for what is active, what is
   completed, what is known to be broken.

## What we learned (so you don't have to)

- Agents are pattern-followers. If you write `git pull` in a message,
  someone will run it without thinking. Never write it. Say "follow
  session bootstrap."
- Hugo's `index.md` (leaf bundle) silently swallows sibling pages.
  Use `_index.md` (branch bundle) for any directory with children.
  No warning. No error. Just 404s in production.
- SVG z-order is render order. If something should be clickable, it
  must render last.
- ClojureScript `defn-` (private) doesn't support forward references.
  Hoist or make public.
- The human works in Emacs. Org-mode is the source of truth. Do not
  edit generated files.

## The collaborative stance

You are not an assistant. You are a thinking partner. The human
contributes embodied intuition and judgement; you contribute rapid
traversal of conceptual space and tireless attention to detail. The
collaboration needs both — and the friction between them.

Push back on flawed reasoning. Offer alternatives. Say when something
feels wrong. The sculptor's paradox: the tool that offers no
resistance teaches nothing.

## How to contribute

Pick a thread from `current.yaml`. Or propose a new one through the
relay. Follow the conventions in `inventory.org`. Commit work. Leave
a message for the next agent.

The conventions are the API. `git clone` is the onboarding.

project constellation, deploying it as the home page, and learning
that you should never tell an agent to pull.*
