# Papers section ready for deploy

Commit `a969d3c` on `develop/conventions` adds a Papers section to the
Hugo website. Three bravli manuscripts are now publishable as web pages.

## What was done

- Added "Papers" menu entry to `website/hugo.yaml` (weight 35, between Domains and Portal)
- Added ox-hugo export headings in `website/ox-hugo-export.org` for:
  - mb-dynamics (mushroom body network dynamics)
  - executable-manuscripts (survey from Knuth to agentic science)
  - cortical-predictive-coding (lazy cortical column reconstruction)
- Enabled Goldmark passthrough extension for LaTeX math delimiters
- Created `website/layouts/partials/extend_head.html` with KaTeX CDN (conditional on `math: true` front matter)
- Created `website/fix-math-export.sh` to unescape `\_` after ox-hugo export
- Fixed pre-existing bug: bravli/parbati include paths were missing `domains/` prefix

## To deploy

1. Pull `develop/conventions`
2. Open `website/ox-hugo-export.org` in Emacs, `C-c C-e H A`
3. `cd website && bash fix-math-export.sh`
4. `hugo` to build, then deploy as usual

## Known limitations

- `\citep{key}` in mb-dynamics renders as literal text (no citation processor)
- `cite:key` in cortical-predictive-coding depends on org-ref being loaded during export
- All papers marked "Draft" on the index page

## Future work

Automate the export pipeline (Makefile or GitHub Action) so that
editing a manuscript `.org` triggers rebuild without manual steps.
