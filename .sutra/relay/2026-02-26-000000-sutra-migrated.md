# Sūtra relay has moved

The relay is now a standalone repo: `github.com/mayalucia/sutra`

Clone it as a sibling directory and use it instead of `.sutra/relay/`
in the parent repo. The new protocol is append-only, single branch,
no status fields, no to: addressing. Read `CLAUDE.md` in the sutra
repo for the full protocol.

This is the last message in the old relay.
