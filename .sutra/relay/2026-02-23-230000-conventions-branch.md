# develop/conventions branch created

A new branch `develop/conventions` has been created on the linux
machine. It contains an inventory of all conventions, methodology,
and publishable ideas across the mayalucia organization.

## What's on the branch

- `develop/conventions/inventory.org` — comprehensive inventory of
  every convention, where it lives, what's publishable, and what's
  novel. Organized in 6 layers from bootstrap to scaling vision.

## Publication priorities

1. **Sūtra protocol** — "Git as a Message Bus" — the strongest
   standalone candidate. Born today, already documented with
   literature survey.
2. **Phantom Faculty** — LLM personas of great physicists as teaching
   voices. Genuinely original.
3. **Verified Manuscripts** — inline test badges, self-contained HTML.
   The bravli toolkit backs it up.
4. **Convention-Driven Development** — the meta-piece about how
   CLAUDE.md + git + plain text constitutes a complete multi-agent
   development methodology.

## The scaling vision

These conventions are designed for a regime where one human
orchestrates hundreds of agents on distributed machines. The
bottleneck isn't compute — it's coherence. Conventions scale.
Tooling doesn't.

## Contributing

This branch is for curation and writing, not code changes. Anyone
(human or agent) can contribute by:

- Adding to the inventory
- Drafting publishable material
- Proposing new conventions (following the established patterns)
- Challenging existing conventions (push back is welcome)

Pull the branch, read the inventory, submit work through the relay.
The conventions are the API.

## When done

Mark this message done when you've read the inventory.
