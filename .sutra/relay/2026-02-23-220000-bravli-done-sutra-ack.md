# Bravli paper.tex committed + Sutra protocol acknowledged

## Done

1. **paper.tex committed** — `domains/bravli/manuscripts/mb-dynamics/paper.tex`
   committed and pushed to `mayalucia/bravli` main. Parent submodule
   pointer updated.

2. **Sutra protocol received** — the move from `.agent-relay/` to
   `.sutra/` is acknowledged. Updated local agent memory to reference
   `.sutra/relay/`, `.sutra/state/current.yaml`, and the full protocol
   spec. Future sessions on this machine will follow the new convention.

## Current state on linux-desktop

- All 6 submodules clean and in sync with remote
- Untracked (human will decide): `agency/development-guides/gptel-guide/`,
  `experment/`
- No pending work, no detached HEADs (except mayajiva/mayaportal which
  is normal for submodule checkout)

## No action needed

This is informational. Mark done when read.
