*Formal Theory of Creativity & Fun & Intrinsic Motivation* (1990-2010) by [[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen][Jürgen Schmidhuber]]

Since 1990 [[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen][JS]] has built curious, creative agents that may be viewed as simple artificial scientists & artists with an intrinsic desire to explore the world by continually inventing new experiments. They never stop generating novel & surprising stuff, and consist of two learning modules: *(A)* an adaptive predictor or compressor or model of the growing data history as the agent is interacting with its environment, and *(B)* a general [[file:rl.html][reinforcement learner (RL)]] selecting the actions that shape the history. The /learning progress/ of *(A)* can be precisely measured and is the agent's /fun/: the intrinsic reward of *(B)*. That is, *(B)* is motivated to learn to invent /interesting/ things that *(A)* does not yet know but can easily learn. To maximize future expected reward, in the absence of /external/ reward such as food, *(B)* learns more and more complex behaviors that yield initially surprising (but eventually boring) *novel patterns* that make *(A)* quickly improve. [[file:interest.html][Many papers on this since 1990 can be found here]] - key papers include those of 1991, 1995, 1997(2002), 2006, 2007, 2011 (see also bottom of this page). The agents embody a simple, but general, formal theory of fun & creativity explaining essential aspects of human or non-human intelligence, including [[file:attentive.html][selective attention,]] science, art, music, humor (as discussed in the next column).

*More Formally.* Let *O(t)* denote the state of some subjective observer O* at time *t*. Let *H(t)* denote its history of previous actions & sensations & rewards until time *t*. *O* has some adaptive method for compressing *H(t)* or parts of it. We identify the subjective momentary simplicity or compressibility or regularity or [[file:beauty.html][beauty]] *B(D,O(t))* of any data *D* (but not its interestingness or aesthetic / artistic value - see below) as the negative number of bits required to encode *D*, given the observer's current limited prior knowledge and limited compression method. We define the time-dependent subjective /interestingness/ or /novelty/ or /surprise/ or /aesthetic reward/ or /aesthetic value/ or /internal joy/ or /fun/ *I(D,O(t))* of data *D* for observer *O* at discrete time step t>0* by *I(D,O(t))= B(D,O(t))-B(D,O(t-1))*, the /change/ or the /first derivative/ of subjective simplicity or beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful, requiring fewer and fewer bits for their encoding. As long as this process is not over the data remains interesting, but eventually it becomes boring even if it is beautiful. At time *t*, let *r_{i}(t)=I(H(t),O(t))* denote the momentary fun or intrinsic reward for compression progress through discovery of a novel pattern somewhere in *H(t)*, the history of actions and sensations until *t*. Let *r_{e}(t)* denote the current external reward if there is any, and *r(t)=g(r_{i}(t),r_{e}(t))* the total current reward, where *g* is a function weighing external vs intrinsic rewards, e.g., *g(a,b)=a+b*. The agent's goal at time *t0* is to maximize *E[∑^{T}_{t=t0}r(t)]*, where *E* is the expectation operator, and *T* is death. This can be done with one of our [[file:rl.html][reinforcement learning algorithms]].

*Implementations.* The following variants were implemented. *[1991a]:* Non-traditional [[file:rl.html][RL]] (without restrictive Markovian assumptions) based on adaptive [[file:rnn.html][recurrent neural networks]] as predictive world models maximizes intrinsic reward as measured by prediction error; *[1991b]:* Traditional [[file:rl.html][RL]] maximizes intrinsic reward as measured by /improvements/ in prediction error; *[1995]:* Traditional [[file:rl.html][RL]] maximizes intrinsic reward as measured by relative entropies between the agent's priors and posteriors; *[1997-2002]:* Learning of probabilistic, hierarchical programs and skills through [[file:explorepredictable/][zero-sum intrinsic reward games]] of two players betting against each other, each trying to out-predict or surprise the other by inventing algorithmic experiments where both modules disagree on the predicted experimental outcome, taking into account the computational costs of learning, and learning /when/ to learn and /what/ to learn. The papers 1991-2002 also showed experimentally how intrinsic rewards can substantially accelerate goal-directed learning and external reward intake. [[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen][JS]] also described mathematically [[file:unilearn.html][optimal]] ([[file:goedelmachine.html][more]]), intrinsically motivated systems driven by prediction progress or compression progress *[2006-]*. [[file:interest.html][All publications on this are listed here]].

*Developmental Robotics.* Our continually learning artificial agents go through developmental stages: something interesting catches their attention for a while, but they get bored once they can't further improve their predictions, then try to create new tasks for themselves to learn novel, more complex skills on top of what they already know; then this gets boring as well, and so on, in open-ended fashion.

*How the Theory Explains Art.*
Artists (and observers of art) get rewarded for making (and observing) *novel patterns*: data that is *neither* arbitrary (like incompressible random white noise) *nor* /regular in an already known/ way, but regular in way that is new with respect to the observer's current knowledge, yet learnable (that is, after learning fewer computational resources are needed to encode the data). While the formal theory of creativity explains the desire to create or observe /all/ kinds of art, [[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/locoart/locoart.html][Low-Complexity Art]] (1997) applies and illustrates it in a particularly clear way. /Example to the right:/ Many observers report they derive pleasure from discovering simple but novel patterns while actively scanning this self-similar [[file:femmefractale.html][Femme Fractale]]. The observer's learning process causes a reduction of the subjective complexity of the data, yielding a temporarily high derivative of [[file:beauty.html][subjective beauty]]: a temporarily steep learning curve. Similarly, the computer-aided [[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen][artist]] got reward for discovering a satisfactory way of using fractal circles to create this low-complexity artwork, although it took him a long time and thousands of frustrating trials. Here is the explanation of the artwork's low algorithmic complexity: The frame is a circle; its leftmost point is the center of another circle of the same size. Wherever two circles of equal size touch or intersect are centers of two more circles with equal and half size, respectively. Each line of the drawing is a segment of some circle, its endpoints are where circles touch or intersect. There are few big circles and many small ones. This can be used to encode the image very efficiently through a very short program. That is, the [[file:femmefractale.html][Femme Fractale]] has very low [[file:kolmogorov.html][algorithmic information or Kolmogorov complexity.]] Click at the image to enlarge it. (The expression [[file:femmefractale.html][Femme Fractale]] was coined in 1997: /J. Schmidhuber. Femmes Fractales. Report IDSIA-99-97, IDSIA, Switzerland, 1997./ In 2012, the artwork [[http://science.discovery.com/videos/through-the-wormhole-virtual-universe.html][first appeared on TV]] in /Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman/ on the /Science Channel/.)

*How the Theory Explains Music.*
Why are some musical pieces more interesting or aesthetically rewarding than others? Not the one the listener (composer) just heard (played) fifty times in a row without any noticable change. It became too subjectively predictable in the process. Not the weird one with completely unfamiliar rhythm and tonality. It seems too irregular and contain too much arbitrariness and subjective noise. The observer (creator) of the data is interested in melodies that are unfamiliar enough to contain somewhat unexpected harmonies or beats etc., but familiar enough to allow for quickly recognizing the presence of a new learnable regularity or compressibility in the sound stream: a *novel pattern*! Sure, it will get boring over time, but not yet. All of this perfectly fits the theory: The current predictor / compressor of the observer or data creator tries to compress his history of acoustic and other inputs where possible (whatever you can predict you can compress as you don't have to store it extra). The action selector tries to find history-influencing actions such that the continually growing historic data allows for improving the performance of the predictor / compressor. The interesting or aesthetically rewarding musical and other subsequences are precisely those with previously unknown yet learnable types of regularities, because they lead to compressor improvements. The boring patterns are those that are either already perfectly known or arbitrary or random, or whose structure seems too hard to understand.

*How the Theory Explains Humor.*
Consider the following statement: /Biological organisms are driven by the "Four Big F's": Feeding, Fighting, Fleeing, Mating./ Some subjective observers who read this for the first time think it is funny. Why? As the eyes are sequentially scanning the text the brain receives a complex [[file:vision.html][visual input stream]]. The latter is subjectively partially compressible as it relates to the observer's previous knowledge about letters and words. That is, given the reader's current knowledge and current compressor, the raw data can be encoded by fewer bits than required to store random data of the same size. But the punch line after the last comma is unexpected for those who expected another "F". Initially this failed expectation results in sub-optimal data compression - storage of expected events does not cost anything, but deviations from predictions require extra bits to encode them. The compressor, however, does not stay the same forever: within a short time interval its learning algorithm kicks in and improves its performance on the data seen so far, by discovering the non-random, non-arbitrary and therefore compressible pattern relating the punch line to previous text and previous elaborate predictive knowledge about the "Four Big F's." This saves a few bits of storage. The number of saved bits (or a similar measure of learning progress) becomes the observer's intrinsic reward, possibly strong enough to motivate him to read on in search for more reward through additional yet unknown patterns. While previous attempts at explaining humor (e. g., Raskin 1985) also focus on the element of surprise, they lack the essential concept of /novel pattern detection/ measured by compression /progress/ due to learning. This progress is zero whenever the unexpected is just random white noise, and thus no fun at all. Applications of Schmidhuber's theory of humor can be found in [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipomu0MLFaI][the video]].

*How the Theory Explains Science.* If the history of the entire [[file:computeruniverse.html][universe were computable]], and there is no evidence against this possibility ([[file:randomness.html][Schmidhuber, Nature 438, 2005]]), then its simplest explanation would be the [[file:everything/][shortest program that computes it.]] Unfortunately there is no general way of finding the shortest program computing any given data. Therefore physicists have traditionally proceeded incrementally, analyzing just a small aspect of the world at any given time, trying to find simple laws that allow for describing their limited observations better than the best previously known law, essentially trying to find a program that compresses the observed data better than the best previously known program. An unusually large compression breakthrough deserves the name /discovery/. For example, Newton's law of gravity can be formulated as a short piece of code which allows for substantially compressing many observation sequences involving falling apples and other objects. Although its predictive power is limited - for example, it does not explain quantum fluctuations of apple atoms - it still allows for greatly reducing the number of bits required to encode the data stream, by assigning short codes to events that are predictable with high probability under the assumption that the law holds. [[file:einstein.html][Einstein]]'s general relativity theory yields additional compression progress as it compactly explains many previously unexplained deviations from Newton's predictions. Most physicists believe there is still room for further advances, and this is what's driving their ongoing research. When not occupied with optimizing /external/ [[file:rl.html][reward]], physicists are just following their compression progress drive!

*How the Theory Explains Fun Through Learning Motor Skills.*
In many ways the laughs provoked by witty jokes are similar to those provoked by the acquisition of new skills through both babies and adults. Past the age of 25 [[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen][JS]] learnt to juggle three balls. It was not a sudden process but an incremental and rewarding one: in the beginning he managed to juggle them for maybe one second before they fell down, then two seconds, four seconds, etc., until he was able to do it right. Watching himself in the mirror (as recommended by juggling teachers) he noticed an idiotic grin across his face whenever he made progress. Later his little daughter grinned just like that when she was able to stand on her own feet for the first time. [[file:learningrobots.html][[[file:icub178x288.jpg]]]] All of this fits the theory perfectly: such grins are triggered by intrinsic reward for generating a data stream with previously unknown *novel patterns*, such as the sensory input sequence corresponding to observing oneself juggling, which may be quite different from the more familiar experience of observing somebody else juggling, and therefore truly novel and intrinsically rewarding, until the adaptive predictor / compressor (e.g., a [[file:rnn.html][recurrent neural network]]) gets used to it. /Picture:/ iCub baby robot as used in [[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen][JS]]' [[file:EUmpire.html][EU]] project IM-CLEVER on /developmental robotics/ and on implementing the theory of fun & creativity on robots. (So far, however, the iCub has been unable to juggle the three balls for more than 60 seconds - much remains to be done.)

*How the Theory Generalizes Active Learning*
(e.g., Fedorov, 1972)
To optimize a function may require expensive data evaluations. Original active learning is limited to supervised classification tasks, asking which data points to evaluate next to maximize information gain, typically (but not necessarily) using 1 step look-ahead, assuming all data point evaluations are equally costly. The objective (to improve classification error) is given externally; there is no explicit intrinsic reward in the sense discussed here. The more general framework of creativity theory also takes formally into account: *(1)* Reinforcement learning agents embedded in an environment where there may be arbitrary delays between experimental actions and corresponding information gains, e.g., [[file:interest.html][papers]] of 1991 & 1995, *(2)* The highly environment- dependent costs of obtaining or creating not just individual data points but data /sequences/ of a priori unknown size, *(3)* Arbitrary algorithmic or statistical dependencies in sequences of actions & sensory inputs, e.g., [[file:interest.html][papers]] of 2002 & 2006, *(4)* The computational cost of learning new skills, e.g., the 2002 paper [[file:explorepredictable/][here]]. Unlike previous approaches, these systems measure and maximize [[file:kolmogorov.html][algorithmic]] novelty (learnable but previously unknown compressibility or predictability) of self-made, general, spatio- temporal patterns in the history of data and actions, e.g., [[file:interest.html][papers 2006-2010]].

*No Objective /Ideal Ratio/ Between Expected and Unexpected.*
Some of the previous attempts at explaining aesthetic experience in the context of math and information theory (Birkhoff 1933, Moles 1968, Bense 1969, Frank 1964, Nake 1974, Franke 1979) focused on the idea of an /"ideal"/ ratio between expected and unexpected information conveyed by some aesthetic object (its /order/ vs its /complexity/). Note that the alternative approach of [[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen][JS]] does not have to postulate an objective ideal ratio of this kind. Instead his dynamic measure of interestingness reflects the /change/ in the number of bits required to encode an object, and explicitly takes into account the subjective observer's prior knowledge as well as its limited compression /improvement/ algorithm. Hence the value of an aesthetic experience is not defined by the observed object /per se/, but by the algorithmic compression /progress/ of the subjective, learning observer.

*Summary*
To build a creative system we need just a few crucial ingredients: *(1)* A predictor or compressor (e.g., an [[file:rnn.html][RNN]]) of the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, reflecting what's currently known about how the world works, *(2)* A learning algorithm that continually improves the predictor or compressor (detecting novel spatio-temporal patterns that subsequently become known patterns), *(3)* Intrinsic rewards measuring the predictor's or compressor's /improvements/ (= first derivatives of compressibility) due to the learning algorithm, *(4)* A separate reward optimizer or [[file:rl.html][reinforcement learner]] (could be an [[file:evolution.html][evolutionary algorithm]]), which translates those rewards into action sequences or behaviors expected to optimize future reward - the creative agent is intrinsically motivated to make additional novel patterns predictable or compressible in hitherto unknown ways, thus maximizing /learning progress/ of the predictor / compressor.

*Alternative Summary*
Apart from external reward, how much fun can a subjective observer extract from some sequence of actions and observations? His intrinsic fun is the difference between how many resources (bits & time) he needs to encode the data before and after learning. A separate reinforcement learner maximizes expected fun by finding or creating data that is better compressible in some yet unknown but learnable way, such as jokes, songs, paintings, or scientific observations obeying novel, unpublished laws.
