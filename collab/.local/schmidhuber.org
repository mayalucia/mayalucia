    Since 1990 JS has built       YouTube), 40min      
    curious, creative agents       (original at Vimeo),      
    that may be viewed as       20min. JS' theory      
    simple artificial       was also subject of      
    scientists & artists       a TV documentary (BR      
    with an intrinsic desire       "Faszination      
    to explore the world by       Wissen", 29 May

    two learning modules:          
    (A) an adaptive          
    predictor or compressor          
    or model of the growing          
    data history as the          
    agent is interacting          
    with its environment,          
    and (B) a general          
    reinforcement learner          
    (RL) selecting the          
    actions that shape the          
    history. The learning          
    progress of (A) can be          
    precisely measured and          
    is the agent's fun: the          
    intrinsic reward of (B).          
    That is, (B) is          
    motivated to learn to          
    invent interesting          
    things that (A) does not          
    yet know but can easily          
    learn. To maximize          
    future expected reward,          
    in the absence of          
    external reward such as          
    food, (B) learns more          
    and more complex          
    behaviors that yield          
    initially surprising          
    (but eventually boring)          
    novel patterns that make          
    (A) quickly improve.          
    Many papers on this          
    since 1990 can be found          
    here - key papers          
    include those of 1991,          
    1995, 1997(2002), 2006,          
    2007, 2011 (see also          
    bottom of this page).          
    The agents embody a          
    simple, but general,          
    formal theory of fun &          
    creativity explaining          
    essential aspects of          
    human or non-human          
    intelligence, including          
    selective attention,          
    science, art, music,          
    humor (as discussed in          
    the next column).           
              
    More Formally. Let O(t)          
    denote the state of some          
    subjective observer O at          
    time t. Let H(t) denote          
    its history of previous          
    actions & sensations &          
    rewards until time t. O          
    has some adaptive method          
    for compressing H(t) or          
    parts of it. We identify          
    the subjective momentary          
    simplicity or          
    compressibility or          
    regularity or beauty B          
    (D,O(t)) of any data D          
    (but not its          
    interestingness or          
    aesthetic / artistic          
    value - see below) as          
    the negative number of          
    bits required to encode          
    D, given the observer's          
    current limited prior          
    knowledge and limited          
    compression method. We          
    define the          
    time-dependent          
    subjective          
    interestingness or          
    novelty or surprise or          
    aesthetic reward or          
    aesthetic value or          
    internal joy or fun I          
    (D,O(t)) of data D for          
    observer O at discrete          
    time step t>0 by I(D,O          
    (t))= B(D,O(t))-B(D,O          
    (t-1)), the change or          
    the first derivative of          
    subjective simplicity or          
    beauty: as the learning          
    agent improves its          
    compression algorithm,          
    formerly apparently          
    random data parts become          
    subjectively more          
    regular and beautiful,          
    requiring fewer and          
    fewer bits for their          
    encoding. As long as          
    this process is not over          
    the data remains          
    interesting, but          
    eventually it becomes          
    boring even if it is          
    beautiful. At time t,          
    let ri(t)=I(H(t),O(t))          
    denote the momentary fun          
    or intrinsic reward for          
    compression progress          
    through discovery of a          
    novel pattern somewhere          
    in H(t), the history of          
    actions and sensations          
    until t. Let re(t)          
    denote the current          
    external reward if there          
    is any, and r(t)=g(ri          
    (t),re(t)) the total          
    current reward, where g          
    is a function weighing          
    external vs intrinsic          
    rewards, e.g., g          
    (a,b)=a+b. The agent's          
    goal at time t0 is to          
    maximize E[âˆ‘Tt=t0r(t)],          
    where E is the          
    expectation operator,          
    and T is death. This can          
    be done with one of our          
    reinforcement learning          
    algorithms.           
              
    Implementations. The          
    following variants were          
    implemented. [1991a]:          
    Non-traditional RL          
    (without restrictive          
    Markovian assumptions)          
    based on adaptive          
    recurrent neural          
    networks as predictive          
    world models maximizes          
    intrinsic reward as          
    measured by prediction          
    error; [1991b]:          
    Traditional RL maximizes          
    intrinsic reward as          
    measured by improvements          
    in prediction error;          
    [1995]: Traditional RL          
    maximizes intrinsic          
    reward as measured by          
    relative entropies          
    between the agent's          
    priors and posteriors;          
    [1997-2002]: Learning of          
    probabilistic,          
    hierarchical programs          
    and skills through          
    zero-sum intrinsic          
    reward games of two          
    players betting against          
    each other, each trying          
    to out-predict or          
    surprise the other by          
    inventing algorithmic          
    experiments where both          
    modules disagree on the          
    predicted experimental          
    outcome, taking into          
    account the          
    computational costs of          
    learning, and learning          
    when to learn and what          
    to learn. The papers          
    1991-2002 also showed          
    experimentally how          
    intrinsic rewards can          
    substantially accelerate          
    goal-directed learning          
    and external reward          
    intake. JS also          
    described mathematically          
    optimal (more),          
    intrinsically motivated          
    systems driven by          
    prediction progress or          
    compression progress          
    [2006-]. All

    Developmental Robotics.          
    Our continually learning          
    artificial agents go          
    through developmental          
    stages: something          
    interesting catches          
    their attention for a          
    while, but they get          
    bored once they can't          
    further improve their          
    predictions, then try to          
    create new tasks for          
    themselves to learn          
    novel, more complex          
    skills on top of what          
    they already know; then          
    this gets boring as          
    well, and so on, in          
    open-ended fashion.

      incompressible random    ways the laughs provoked    
      white noise) nor regular    by witty jokes are    
      in an already known way,    similar to those    
      but regular in way that is    provoked by the    
      new with respect to the    acquisition of new    
      observer's current    skills through both

      Many observers report they    to do it right. Watching

      novel patterns while    juggling teachers) he

      beauty: a temporarily    theory perfectly: such    
      steep learning curve.    grins are triggered by    
      Similarly, the    intrinsic reward for    
      computer-aided artist got    generating a data stream    
      reward for discovering a    with previously unknown

      thousands of frustrating    quite different from the    
      trials. Here is the    more familiar experience    
      explanation of the    of observing somebody    
      artwork's low algorithmic    else juggling, and    
      complexity: The frame is a    therefore truly novel    
      circle; its leftmost point    and intrinsically    
      is the center of another    rewarding, until the    
      circle of the same size.    adaptive predictor /    
      Wherever two circles of    compressor (e.g., a    
      equal size touch or    recurrent neural    
      intersect are centers of    network) gets used to    
      two more circles with    it. Picture: iCub baby    
      equal and half size,    robot as used in JS' EU    
      respectively. Each line of    project IM-CLEVER on    
      the drawing is a segment    developmental robotics    
      of some circle, its    and on implementing the    
      endpoints are where    theory of fun &    
      circles touch or    creativity on robots.    
      intersect. There are few    (So far, however, the    
      big circles and many small    iCub has been unable to    
      ones. This can be used to    juggle the three balls    
      encode the image very    for more than 60 seconds
