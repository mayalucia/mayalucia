* Overview
A layered set of modules translating between Scientific Model (truth) and Manifestation (perception), orchestrated by an Agent.

* Modules
** Knowledge Substrate (Scientific Model)
- Capture formal domain models: physics, biology, geology, cognition.
- Store equations, constraints, priors, and causal graphs.
- Provide APIs for querying semantics, units, and uncertainty.

** Data Ingestion & Harmonization
- Intake heterogeneous raw data (measurements, images, text, logs).
- Normalize formats, units, coordinate frames; attach provenance.
- Perform quality checks; emit uncertainty/coverage metadata.

** Inference & Parameter Estimation
- Map harmonized data to model parameters and latent states.
- Support inverse problems, Bayesian updates, and identifiability checks.
- Produce posteriors with confidence intervals ready for simulation.

** Simulation & Forward Models
- Execute mechanistic simulations consistent with estimated parameters.
- Offer surrogate models/emulators for speed with fidelity bounds.
- Track reproducibility: seeds, versions, environment manifests.

** Rendering & Manifestation Layer
- Convert simulated states to perceivable artifacts: visuals, audio, haptics, text.
- Apply perceptual models and storytelling templates for clarity.
- Support multi-resolution outputs (quick previews to high-fidelity renders).

** Evaluation & Validation
- Compare Manifestation against ground-truth data and domain benchmarks.
- Compute fit metrics, perceptual validity, and scientific consistency tests.
- Close the loop by feeding diagnostics back to Inference and Knowledge Substrate.

** Agentic Orchestration Layer
- Policy engine that sequences module calls based on goals and feedback.
- Maintains task plans, monitors data lineage, enforces constraints.
- Hosts conversational interface for human guidance and explanation.

** Tooling & Interfaces
- Common schema: units, time/space refs, provenance tags.
- Adapters for external tools (simulators, ML frameworks, visualization stacks).
- Logging, versioning, and audit trail services accessible across modules.

** Safety, Ethics, and Governance
- Guardrails for data governance, consent, and bias checks.
- Risk assessment for generated Manifestations (misleading artifacts, overclaiming).
- Compliance hooks for domain-specific standards and approvals.

** Experiment Notebook & Automation
- Reproducible pipelines defined as declarative workflows.
- Auto-generated reports linking inputs → models → Manifestations.
- Hooks for active learning: propose next experiments to reduce uncertainty.
