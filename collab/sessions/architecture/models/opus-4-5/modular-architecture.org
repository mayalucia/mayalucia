* Overview

=MayaLucIA= is a system of /layered translations/ between three conceptual planes:

| Plane              | Nature                                      |
|--------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| Scientific Model   | What is true (physics, constraints, laws)   |
| Digital Twin       | What is reconstructed (the artifact)        |
| Manifestation      | What is perceived (sight, sound, interaction) |

An *Agent* mediates between these planes, acting as translator and guide. The architecture below describes the core modules needed to implement this vision.


* Module 1: Data Anchors

/The sparse skeleton from which the dense reconstruction grows./

** Purpose
Ingest, curate, and index heterogeneous measurement data that serve as /boundary conditions/ for reconstruction. These are the "landmark pieces" that constrain all else.

** What to Implement
- *Data Connectors* :: Adapters for various sources (files, APIs, databases, instruments).
- *Anchor Registry* :: A catalog of ingested data with metadata (resolution, uncertainty, provenance).
- *Constraint Tagging* :: Mark which measurements carry high constraining power for downstream inference.

** Key Principle
Not all data is equal. We seek measurements with /maximal interdependency leverage/—those that, once fixed, force many other parameters into place.


* Module 2: Conceptual Chisel (Scientific Models)

/The physical laws and principles that propagate constraints./

** Purpose
Encode the interdependencies among variables. This module holds the "rules of nature" that allow sparse data to imply dense structure.

** What to Implement
- *Model Library* :: A collection of scientific models (equations, rules, heuristics) organized by domain (geology, neuroscience, fluid dynamics, etc.).
- *Constraint Propagation Engine* :: Given anchor data and a model, infer what /must/ exist to satisfy physical laws.
- *Composition Interface* :: Allow models to be combined (e.g., geology + climate → hydrology).

** Key Principle
The chisel is not arbitrary—it encodes /known/ interdependencies. The reconstruction is rigorous exploitation of constraints, not guesswork.


* Module 3: Digital Twin Forge

/Where the reconstruction materializes as a computational artifact./

** Purpose
Generate, store, and manage the dense digital twin that emerges from anchor data + scientific models. This is the "revealed sculpture."

** What to Implement
- *Sparse-to-Dense Pipeline* :: Algorithms that fill the void between measurements using constraint propagation.
- *Twin Repository* :: Versioned storage of reconstructed artifacts (geometry, fields, connectivity, etc.).
- *Consistency Validator* :: Check that the twin satisfies all imposed constraints and flags violations.

** Key Principle
The twin is not a static snapshot but a /self-consistent instance/—every part must cohere with every other part according to the governing models.


* Module 4: Manifestation Renderer

/Translating abstract models into perceptible forms./

** Purpose
Transform the digital twin into visual, auditory, or interactive experiences that human senses can interpret. This is where "art as checksum" occurs.

** What to Implement
- *Visual Renderer* :: 3D landscapes, circuit diagrams, field visualizations.
- *Sonification Engine* :: Translate dynamics (spike trains, flow rates, seismic signals) into sound.
- *Interactive Interface* :: Allow the user to navigate, probe, and manipulate the twin in real time.

** Key Principle
Manifestation is /diagnostic/. If something looks or sounds "wrong," it signals a violation of interdependence in the underlying model.


* Module 5: Sculpting Agent

/The translator between human intent and computational artifact./

** Purpose
Orchestrate the measure-model-manifest-refine cycle. The agent understands both the physics (Module 2) and the rendering pipeline (Module 4), helping the user navigate between them.

** What to Implement
- *Dialogue Interface* :: Natural language interaction for querying, guiding, and refining the reconstruction.
- *Task Orchestration* :: Coordinate calls to other modules (fetch data, run inference, render, validate).
- *Explanation Engine* :: Articulate /why/ the reconstruction looks the way it does—trace back to anchors and constraints.
- *Suggestion Generator* :: Propose next steps (new measurements, model refinements, alternative renderings).

** Key Principle
The agent keeps the human in the loop. The "sculpting" process—deciding what details matter—is where understanding happens. The agent assists but does not replace human judgment.


* Module 6: Iteration & Refinement Loop

/The cycle through which understanding deepens./

** Purpose
Close the feedback loop: compare manifestation to expectation, identify gaps, refine models and data.

** What to Implement
- *Comparison Tools* :: Overlay new measurements or expert intuition against the current twin.
- *Gap Detector* :: Identify where the model diverges from observation or expectation.
- *Refinement Interface* :: Adjust anchors, modify models, or request new data.
- *Journey Log* :: Document each iteration—what changed, why, what was learned.

** Key Principle
Iteration is not debugging; it is /understanding/. Each cycle asks new questions and refines the principles binding the parameters.


* Module Dependencies

The modules form a directed flow with feedback:

* Next Steps

To proceed, we should:

- [ ] Prioritize which module to prototype first (likely Data Anchors or Sculpting Agent).
- [ ] Choose a concrete domain (mountain valley or brain circuit) as the test case.
- [ ] Define the minimal data structures and interfaces between modules.
- [ ] Identify existing libraries/tools that can be leveraged for each module.

I await your direction on which aspect to develop further.

** Summary of the Proposed Architecture

The framework breaks down into six interconnected modules:

| Module              | Role                                                    |
|---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Anchors        | Ingest sparse measurements as boundary conditions       |
| Conceptual Chisel   | Encode scientific models that propagate constraints     |
| Digital Twin Forge  | Generate dense, self-consistent reconstructions         |
| Manifestation       | Render artifacts into perceptible forms                 |
| Sculpting Agent     | Orchestrate the human-machine dialogue                  |
| Iteration Loop      | Close the feedback cycle for refinement                 |

The key insight from your vision documents is that this is not a linear pipeline but a /cycle/. The Sculpting Agent sits at the center, mediating between your intent and the computational machinery, while the Iteration Loop ensures that each pass through the system deepens understanding rather than merely producing output.

** Questions for Clarification

Before we proceed to more concrete specifications, I have a few questions:

1. /Entry Point/: Do you envision starting with the Sculpting Agent (the orchestrator) or with one of the "substrate" modules (Data Anchors, Conceptual Chisel)?

2. /Test Domain/: Would you prefer to ground the initial prototype in =parbati= (mountain modeling) or =bravli= (brain circuits)? The choice will shape which scientific models we prioritize in the Conceptual Chisel.

3. /Agent Technology/: For the Sculpting Agent, are you thinking of an LLM-based conversational interface, a more structured task-oriented agent, or a hybrid?
