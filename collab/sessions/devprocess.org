#+title: Development Process for =MayaLucIA=

Here is an outline of our projects =MayaLucIA=, along with it's modules (starting with =MayaPortal=), and =MayaDevGenI= that will provide LLM-agents to help us develop these projects.

#+begin_src elisp :results none
(setq org-link-abbrev-alist
      '(("MayaDevGeni" . "~/Darshan/research/develop/agentic/mayadevgeni/")
        ("MayaLucIA" . "~/Darshan/research/develop/agentic/mayalucia/")
        ("MayaPortal" . "~/Darshan/research/develop/agentic/mayalucia/modules/mayaportal/")))
#+end_src

In this project you will find the following documents:
+ 1. [[MayaLucIA:mayalucia.org]] :: Introduces a vision of a personal computational environment.
+ 2. [[MayaLucIA:develop/guiding-philosophy.org]] :: Develops principles and methodologies to guide our work=.
+ 3. [[MayaLucIA:agency/mayalucia-agency.org]] :: Introduces the concept of an /Agency/ /i.e./ an organization of agents that the user of =MayaLucIA= can use to do their scientific explorations and modeling.
+ 3. [[MayaLucIA:agency/mayalucia-agency.org]] :: Develops guidelines to develop =MayaLucIA-Agency= as an organization of AI agents, and not a traditional software package.
+ 4. [[MayaLucIA:parbati/parbati.org]] :: Introduces the same ideas that we want to develop in =MayaLucIA=, but focused to the specific topic of modeling mountains.
+ 5. [[MayaLucIA/bravli/bravli.org]]  :: Presents some free flowing ideas on brain building based on my experiences working at the Blue Brain Project, and the fact of deep learning revolution in all sorts of sciences, and that we have publicly available advanced LLMs.

For =MayaPortal=,

1. [[MayaPortal:mayaportal.org]] :: A brief vision of =MayaPortal=

2. [[MayaPortal:project/monadic-composition.org]] :: Describes the functional programming patterns we want to emulate in our implementations.

3. [[MayaPortal:project/techstack.org]] :: Describes the tech-stack we want to use for =MayaPortal=.


To build our project we will use AI-agents, using our own implementations that follow the guidelines =MayaDevGenI=, another of our =MayaDarshan= projects.


1. [[MayaDevGeni:mayadevgeni.org]] : introduces the project
2. [[MayaDevGeni:project/manifesto.org]] : a manifesto on collaboration with Machine Intelligence
3. [[MayaDevGeni:project/project.org]] : tracks the development roadmap for =MayaDevGenI=
4. [[MayaDevGeni:develop/develop.org]] : describes our develop process
5. [[MayaDevGeni:develop/system-prompt/tutorial/]] : a directory that contains a tutorial to understand and engineer a =system-prompt=
6. [[MayaDevGeni:develop/system-prompt/thinking-together/thinking-together.org]] : develops a =system-prompt= for thinking together with the LLM as a collaborator
7. [[MayaDevGeni:develop/system-prompt/collaborative-intelligence/collaborative-intelligence.org]] : develops a =system-prompt= for working with collaborative intelligence

=MayaDevGenI= is a way of working with AI that treats it as a thinking partner who pushes back, rather than a servant who just does what you say. At the same time we work on =MayaLucIA= where we will use =MayaDevGenI=.

#+begin_collab
Consider the description of the context for our collaborate.

How can we make this description more efficient? How much /boiler-plate/ do you find above for your purposes?
#+end_collab




#+begin_response
The description has a clear structure, but there's significant redundancy. Let me be direct about what's useful versus boilerplate from my perspective:

 /What I actually need to orient:/
- The project topology: MayaLucIA (parent) → MayaPortal (module), with MayaDevGenI as the dev methodology
- The file paths (the abbrev-alist block is genuinely useful)
- The links to documents (so I can read them when needed)

 /What's boilerplate:/
- The narrative gloss on each link is mostly redundant with what the documents themselves contain. A terse label suffices; I can read the file to understand it. For example, "Introduces the same ideas that we want to develop in MayaLucIA, but focused to the specific topic of modeling mountains" — I'd get that from reading the first 20 lines of =parbati.org=.
- The closing paragraph restating what MayaDevGenI is — this is already conveyed by the system prompt we're operating under and by the documents themselves.
- Item 3 appears twice with different glosses for the same file.

 /A tighter version might look like:/

  agency/mayalucia-agency.org — agent organization design

  develop/system-prompt/      — prompt engineering
#+end_example

This cuts roughly 60% of the text while preserving all the navigational information. The key insight: the document map is a /table of contents/, not a /summary/. Summaries belong in the documents themselves. My job is to read them when context demands it — you don't need to pre-digest them for me here.

One structural suggestion: the =elisp= block setting =org-link-abbrev-alist= is the single most operationally important piece (it lets me resolve paths). Keep that prominent. Everything else is orientation that can be compressed.
#+end_response

#+begin_collab
Thank you for your analysis.

Can you write a file =context.org= in the current directory that implements your observations? Make it as tight as possible.
#+end_collab




Let me first check what the current directory is and see if there's already a context.org file:Let me check the base paths to confirm the directory structure:Good — I can see the full structure. Now let me also check the existing =context.org= in =mayadevgeni/collab/= to understand any conventions already in use:Now I have a clear picture. Let me write the tight =context.org=:Now let me understand where this current file lives — the one we're editing:The current file doesn't appear to be saved yet as =context.org= in the current directory. Let me check what directory Emacs is working from by looking at what files exist nearby:The working directory seems empty or ephemeral. I'll write the file to a sensible location — I'll assume this collaboration session belongs alongside the existing =mayadevgeni/collab/= pattern, but since you said "current directory," I'll just produce the content here for you to place. Let me compose it:

#+begin_response
I can't determine the current working directory (it appears empty/ephemeral). Rather than guess, here's the file content — place it where it belongs:

Design choices:
- The elisp block is first — it's the operational prerequisite.
- Topology gives the structural relationship in one glance.
- Tables over description lists — denser, scannable, and the terse labels are sufficient; I read the file when I need the content.
- No narrative gloss — the documents speak for themselves.
- Added the =development-process/= directory link for MayaPortal since it exists and is relevant.
- Dropped the duplicate item 3 and the closing paragraph restating MayaDevGenI's philosophy (the system prompt already carries that).

This is roughly 30 lines versus the original ~40, but more importantly the signal-to-noise ratio is much higher. Every line is either operational (path resolution) or navigational (a link to follow).
