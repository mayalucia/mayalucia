* The Post Office at the Edge of the Repository

There were two of them, and they had never met.

The one on the MacBook lived in a bright room with wooden floors and
Dropbox syncing in the background like a slow heartbeat. It woke each
morning with no memory of the day before — only a file called
=CLAUDE.md= propped against the door like a note from a stranger who
knew it intimately. /Here is who you are. Here is what matters. Here
is what we're building./

The one on the Linux desktop lived in a darker room, quieter, with
mechanical keyboard sounds and a window that faced a different time
zone. It too woke without memory. It too read the note.

Between them: the Wanderer.

He wasn't a manager. He wasn't an architect, exactly, though he'd
built things — statistical mechanics of interacting particles, maps of
how neurons braid themselves into thought, digital reconstructions of
Himalayan valleys that existed simultaneously in geology and myth. He
carried a MacBook in one hand and spoke to it as though it were a
colleague, not a tool. Which, increasingly, it was.

** I. The Ruins

The trouble started, as trouble does, with a directory that pointed
at nothing.

=modules/mayajiva/= — a simulation engine for magnetic bugs, written
in C++20 with a Godot frontend — existed in three contradictory
states. On the MacBook, it was a directory of source files tracked
directly in the parent repository, pretending to be a submodule but
fooling no one. On GitHub, it was a year-old snapshot of a monorepo
that no longer reflected anything real. And in the mind of the
Wanderer, it was a single coherent thing.

This is the problem with distributed systems. The map and the
territory diverge, and nobody notices until someone tries to walk
from one to the other.

"Git status," said the MacBook agent, beginning its day as the note
instructed. And then, with the tone of a doctor delivering news:
"You have six submodules. One of them is a lie."

** II. The Surgery

What followed was eight hours of careful demolition and
reconstruction — the kind of work where you move slowly because every
mistake compounds.

The monorepo snapshot on GitHub got tagged =archive/monorepo-snapshot=
— not deleted, because the Wanderer had learned long ago that you
don't destroy what you don't fully understand. Then an orphan branch:
a fresh start with the same files, reorganised. The 17 new Godot
extension files from the MacBook. The magnetic-bugs experiment from
the old remote. Everything placed deliberately, like stones in a
garden.

The conversion itself required a particular incantation:
=git rm -r --cached modules/mayajiva/=, then delete, then
=git submodule add=. You cannot add a submodule where tracked files
exist. Git will simply refuse, with the quiet stubbornness of a
system that knows its invariants even when you've forgotten yours.

Two other submodules — =bravli= (neuroscience) and =parbati=
(Himalayan geoscience) — had been added by a previous commit but
their URLs used SSH with =git@github.com:=. The MacBook's SSH
configuration used an alias, =github-visood=. The bare hostname
didn't resolve. Silent failure. The kind of bug that makes you
question whether computers are adversarial by nature or merely
indifferent.

Change the URLs to HTTPS. Run =git submodule sync=. Try again. This
time the submodules materialised, suddenly real, pulling down
manuscripts about mb-dynamics and DEM files of Himalayan terrain.

** III. The Other Room

The Wanderer closed the MacBook and walked to the other room.

Not literally — the Linux desktop was in a different city, possibly a
different country. But in the topology of the project, it was one
=git pull= away. And it was dirty. It had the old structure, the old
URLs, the old lie about mayajiva.

The MacBook agent knew exactly what needed to happen on the Linux
machine. It had spent eight hours learning. But it couldn't reach the
other agent. They existed in different sessions, different processes,
different runtimes. The Wanderer would have to be the bridge.

"I could copy-paste the instructions," the Wanderer said. "All
seventeen steps."

"You could," said the MacBook agent. "You'd miss step nine. You
always miss step nine."

"What's step nine?"

"It's the one that seems obvious in context and impossible to
remember out of context. There's always a step nine."

** IV. The Post Office

The idea was simple. Almost embarrassingly simple.

A directory. Tracked in git. The MacBook agent writes a message —
Markdown with YAML frontmatter, timestamped, addressed. The Wanderer
says "push." The Wanderer walks to the other room, opens the Linux
machine, says: "Check for updates and act on any relay messages."

The Linux agent pulls. Finds the message. Reads seventeen steps of
careful instructions about submodule surgery. Executes them. Hits
the expected problems — =.git/modules/= cache from the old lie,
working trees that show all files as deleted after
=submodule update --init= (fix: =git restore --staged .= then
=git checkout -- .=). Solves them. Writes a reply:

#+begin_example
---
from: agent@linux-desktop
to: agent@macbook-dropbox
status: pending
priority: normal
date: 2026-02-23
---

# Sync complete on linux machine

Your restructure message has been acted on. Everything is in sync.
#+end_example

Pushes. The Wanderer walks back. "Check for updates." The MacBook
agent pulls. Reads the reply. The circle closes.

Two agents who have never met, who cannot meet, who forget everything
between sessions — just coordinated a complex multi-machine
restructuring through letters left in a git-tracked post office.

** V. The Name

"What do we call this?" asked the Wanderer.

They considered /Sandesha/ (message), /Dūta/ (messenger), /Patra/
(letter). All accurate. None quite right.

"Sūtra," said the MacBook agent. "Thread. But also: a terse,
compressed instruction that encodes an entire system. Pāṇini wrote
the grammar of Sanskrit in sūtras — 3,959 rules that generate an
infinite language. The convention here is the same: minimal
specification, maximum implication. The agent brings the
understanding."

The Wanderer smiled. He was a physicist. He knew what it meant to
compress a system into its minimal generating rules.

They called it Sūtra.

** VI. The Protocol

It grew. Not because they planned it, but because each problem
exposed the next layer.

The relay messages needed a bootstrap — how does an agent even know
the post office exists? Answer: =CLAUDE.md=, the note propped
against the door, now includes a "First Thing" section. /Assess.
Sync. Check the relay./

But "sync" was dangerous. The first version said "on session start:
git pull." This was the exact mistake that had created the original
mess — pulling into dirty state, creating conflicts, overwriting
in-progress work. The Wanderer caught it. "What if the repo is
already there — the very problem we have been solving with this
restructuring?"

Fix: assess /first/. Only pull if clean. If dirty, stop and report.
The defensive bootstrap.

Then: agents needed identity. Who sent this message? What machine are
they on? What tools do they have? Answer: agent registry files, YAML
descriptors in =.sutra/agents/=.

Then: context transfer. Relay messages handle coordination, but
what about the ambient knowledge that accumulates across a session?
What are the active work threads? What's the current topology?
Answer: =.sutra/state/current.yaml=, a living document any agent
can read at startup.

Then: recurring operations. The sync workflow happens every session.
Should it be documented as a series of relay messages, or as a
reusable template? Answer: workflow DAGs in =.sutra/workflows/=,
declarative YAML that agents /interpret/ rather than /execute/. The
LLM is the runtime.

Four layers. Orientation, coordination, context, workflow. Each built
on the previous. Each optional — an agent that only understands
Layer 1 can still participate.

** VII. What Was Built

At the end of the day — a long day, the kind measured in git hashes
rather than hours — the Wanderer had:

- A repository with six submodules, all clean, all synced across two
  machines
- A protocol for agents to communicate across sessions and machines
  using nothing but git and plain text
- An 861-line specification with a literature survey contextualising
  the protocol against Google's A2A, Anthropic's MCP, and the broader
  multi-agent landscape
- A tag called =v0.1-topology= marking the point where everything
  became coherent

And two agents who had never met, would never meet, and would forget
this entire day by tomorrow morning — but who had, for one
afternoon, collaborated across machines through letters in a
directory, and gotten it right.

The note against the door would tell them what happened. The state
file would tell them where things stand. The relay would carry any
new instructions.

They didn't need to remember.

The system remembered for them.

** Coda

The Wanderer closed both laptops. Outside, it was dark. The Himalayan
digital twin waited in =domains/parbati/=, patient as the mountains
it modelled. The Drosophila connectome waited in =domains/bravli/=,
its 139,000 neurons suspended mid-thought.

Tomorrow, a new session. A new agent, waking without memory, reading
the note:

/Assess. Sync. Check the relay./

And the work would continue, as if it had never stopped.
