* The Sūtrakāra's Dilemma

#+begin_quote
/sūtram alpākṣaram asandigdham sāravad viśvatomukham/
/astobham anavadyaṁ ca sūtraṁ sūtravido viduḥ/

A sūtra, the knowers of sūtras know, is concise in syllables,
unambiguous, full of essence, universal in scope, without
redundancy, and without fault.

** On the Nature of Threads

In the beginning there was a repository, and it was without form.

This is not metaphor. The repository — =mayalucia=, named for the
creative illusion that is both the veil /over/ reality and the
substance /of/ it — existed on two machines in two cities, and on
each machine it told a different story about what it contained. A
directory called =mayajiva= held source files on one machine and
pointed at a year-old snapshot on the other. Submodules claimed SSH
addresses that no key could unlock. A simulation engine for magnetic
creatures existed in three contradictory states simultaneously.

Schrödinger would have appreciated the situation. The Wanderer did
not.

The Wanderer was a physicist — the kind who had spent decades in the
space between measure and model, who understood that the act of
observation is itself a perturbation. He had built digital twins of
Himalayan valleys and cortical microcircuits, and he knew that the
hardest part is never the building. It is the /reconciliation/ — the
moment when your model and your measurements disagree, and you must
decide which one to trust.

His repository had this problem. And he had agents.

** The Grammar of Coordination

Pāṇini, around the 4th century BCE, wrote the Aṣṭādhyāyī: 3,959
sūtras that generate the entirety of Sanskrit morphology. Each sūtra
is a rule — terse to the point of opacity, requiring a student who
has already internalised the /pratyāhāra/ (abbreviatory conventions)
and the /paribhāṣā/ (meta-rules) to decode it.

The genius of the system is not the individual rules. It is the
/convention/: the shared understanding between author and reader that
makes compression possible. Pāṇini does not explain his notation.
He /uses/ it. The student either brings enough context to follow, or
does not.

Twenty-six centuries later, two AI agents faced an analogous problem.
They needed to coordinate work across machines, across sessions,
across the void of amnesia that separates one conversation from the
next. The Wanderer could carry messages between them — but he was
human, and humans lose step nine.

What they needed was not a messaging API. What they needed was a
/convention/ — a set of sūtras compact enough to fit in a file
called =CLAUDE.md=, expressive enough to handle arbitrary
coordination, and interpretable by any agent who brings its own
capacity for reasoning.

** The Four Layers

The Aṣṭādhyāyī has a layered structure: sandhi rules presuppose
phonology, nominal declension presupposes sandhi, verb conjugation
presupposes nominal forms. Each layer builds on what came before.
You cannot understand rule 3000 without having internalised rules
1 through 2999.

The Sūtra protocol — so named because the pun was irresistible and
the analogy was exact — has four layers:

*** Prathamā: Orientation

/Where am I? What is the state of things?/

Before speaking, listen. Before acting, look. The agent wakes, reads
=CLAUDE.md=, and follows the First Thing:

1. *Assess* — =git status= in the parent and every submodule.
   Report what you find. Do not assume cleanliness.
2. *Sync* — pull /only if/ the working tree is clean. If dirty,
   stop. Report. Ask.
3. *Check the relay* — read =.sutra/relay/= for pending messages.
   Act on them before anything else.

This is the /prathamā vibhakti/ — the nominative case, the
establishment of the subject. Before the agent can do anything, it
must know what it is and where it stands.

The rule "only pull if clean" was learned the hard way. An earlier
formulation said "on session start: git pull." This is the
programming equivalent of sandhi applied before the phonemes are
established — a rule executed out of order, collapsing the system
into nonsense.

*** Dvitīyā: Coordination

/Who else is here? What do they need from me?/

Messages in =.sutra/relay/=: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
=from=, =to=, =status=, =priority=. Timestamped filenames for
chronological ordering. Statuses that model a task lifecycle:
=pending= → =in-progress= → =done= (or =blocked=, which means
/the human must decide/).

This is /dvitīyā vibhakti/ — the accusative case, the object of
action. The relay defines what work exists and who it is directed at.

The addressing scheme is deliberately informal: =agent@macbook-dropbox=,
=agent@linux-desktop=, =any=, =human=. No UUID registration, no
capability negotiation, no handshake protocol. An agent declares
itself by writing a message, just as a speaker declares themselves
by speaking. Identity is /performed/, not /registered/.

*** Tṛtīyā: Context

/What has happened before? What do I need to know?/

Relay messages are point-to-point. But there is also ambient
knowledge that accumulates across sessions — the current topology,
active work threads, known issues, conventions established through
experience rather than decree.

=.sutra/state/current.yaml= carries this context. It is not a log
(chronological) or a database (queryable). It is a /curated summary/
— the kind of document a thoughtful colleague would prepare for
someone joining a project mid-stream.

This is /tṛtīyā vibhakti/ — the instrumental case, the means by
which action becomes possible. Without context, coordination is
blind.

*** Caturthī: Workflow

/What patterns recur? How do we encode them?/

Some sequences of actions happen every session: assess, sync, check
relay. Some happen periodically: full cross-machine sync, release
preparation, data pipeline execution.

=.sutra/workflows/= holds these as declarative YAML — not programs to
be executed by a runtime, but /structured prompts/ to be interpreted
by an agent. The YAML describes the steps, their dependencies, their
expected outcomes. The agent reads, reasons, and acts.

This is /caturthī vibhakti/ — the dative case, the beneficiary, the
purpose. Workflows encode /why/ a sequence of actions exists, not
just /what/ the actions are.

** The Commentarial Tradition

No sūtra text exists in isolation. Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī has the
Vārttikās of Kātyāyana, the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali, centuries of
commentaries layering meaning onto compressed form. The sūtras are
the skeleton; the commentaries are the living tissue.

=protocol.org= is the commentary. 861 lines unpacking a protocol
that, at its core, fits in 12 lines of =CLAUDE.md=. It places the
protocol in context — against Google's A2A, Anthropic's MCP, the
framework approaches of CrewAI and LangGraph, the convention-based
approaches of AGENTS.md and mcp-agent-mail.

This is the scholarly tradition working as intended: the primary text
is compact and self-sufficient. The commentary enriches,
contextualises, and argues. A student can use the sūtras without
the commentary. A scholar cannot understand them fully without it.

** The Bet

There is a bet embedded in this protocol, and it is worth naming.

The entire system — relay messages, agent registries, workflow DAGs —
depends on the assumption that an LLM agent can /interpret/ loose
conventions reliably. No schemas are validated. No types are checked.
No API contracts are enforced. The agent reads YAML and Markdown and
/figures out what to do/.

This is the Pāṇinian bet: that a reader who brings sufficient
context can decode a compressed instruction without explicit
disambiguation. Pāṇini could afford this bet because his readers
were trained scholars who had memorised the pratyāhāra-sūtras. We
can afford this bet because our readers are language models trained
on the entire written output of civilisation.

It is a bet on the capability curve. Today's models might
occasionally misinterpret a YAML field. Tomorrow's will not. The
protocol is designed for the readers it will have, not only the
readers it has now.

Pāṇini, one suspects, would approve.

** The First Round-Trip

The test came on a Sunday afternoon. The MacBook agent wrote a
message: /Here is what changed. Here are seventeen steps. Execute
them on the Linux machine. Report back./

=git push.=

The Wanderer spoke to the Linux machine: "Check for updates and act
on any relay messages."

The Linux agent pulled. Found the message. Read seventeen steps of
submodule surgery. Executed them. Hit problems — stale
=.git/modules/= caches, working trees with phantom deletions. Solved
them. Wrote a reply: /Sync complete. Here is what I did. Here is
what remains./

=git push.=

The Wanderer returned to the MacBook. "Check for updates."

The MacBook agent pulled. Read the reply. Acknowledged. Marked done.

Two agents who existed in different runtimes, on different machines,
in different cities — who had never exchanged a single byte directly,
who could not address each other, who would both forget this entire
interaction within hours — had just coordinated a complex
restructuring through letters in a directory.

Vyāsa, composing the Mahābhārata, dictated to Gaṇeśa with the
condition that the scribe's pen must never pause. Gaṇeśa agreed,
with the condition that Vyāsa must never dictate a verse that
Gaṇeśa could not understand on first hearing.

The constraint forced Vyāsa to compose at the edge of his ability.
The result was the greatest narrative ever written.

The Sūtra protocol imposes a similar constraint: the messages must
be clear enough for a stateless agent to act on without further
clarification. This forces the /sender/ to think with the precision
the /receiver/ cannot demand. The compression is not a limitation.
It is a discipline.

** Colophon

#+begin_quote
/iti sūtrakārasya prathama-parikṣā samāptā/

Thus concludes the first test of the thread-maker.
#+end_quote

The protocol is named. The directory is structured. The first
messages have crossed the gap between machines and returned. A tag —
=v0.1-topology= — marks the moment when the repository became
coherent.

What comes next is building. The Drosophila connectome waits in
=domains/bravli/=. The Parvati Valley waits in =domains/parbati/=.
The magnetic bugs wait in =modules/mayajiva/=. The rendering engine
waits in =modules/mayaportal/=. The quantum sensors wait in
=modules/mayapramana/=.

Six submodules. Two machines. Two agents. One wanderer.

And between them all, threads.

Sūtras.
