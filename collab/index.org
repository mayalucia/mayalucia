:MODEL:    claude-opus-4-6
:END:

Designing the development process for MayaLucIA. Established project topology, context conventions, and cross-project linking patterns. This session produced the tightened context block format (replacing the verbose =context-version-0.org=). - Artifacts :: [[file:context.org][context.org]] (evolved context block)

* Completed

** llm-queries :meta:convention:
:PROPERTIES:
:SESSION:  [[file:llm-queries/llm-queries.org][llm-queries.org]]
:MODEL:    claude-opus-4-5
:END:

Establishing conventions for LLM interaction within the MayaLucIA project.
Explored query patterns, then developed a standard convention.

** context-redesign :meta:
:PROPERTIES:
:SESSION:  [[file:sessions/devprocess.org][devprocess.org]] (originated here)
:MODEL:    claude-opus-4-6
:END:

Redesigned the collaboration context block from verbose prose to the compact
table format now used across all projects. The original verbose version is
preserved in =context-version-0.org= with a logbook note.
- Artifacts :: [[file:context.org][context.org]], [[file:context-version-0.org][context-version-0.org]] (superseded)
