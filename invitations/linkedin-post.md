# LinkedIn Post — MāyāLucIA Launch

*(Copy below this line)*

---

I've been building something in a basement.

No lab. No grant. No team. Just 20 years of computational science experience,
an Emacs buffer, and an AI thinking partner.

In a few sessions, this collaboration produced:

- A computational neuroscience toolkit analysing the Drosophila mushroom body
  connectome (10 investigations, 293 passing tests)
- A C++ simulation engine validated against Python reference code
- A real-time rendering kernel in C++23 with WebGPU
- A "verified manuscript" — a self-contained HTML document where every
  quantitative claim links to the test that proves it

The verified manuscript is the part I'm most excited about. Imagine reading a
scientific paper where you can click on any result and see the test that
verifies it. Then clone the repo and run those tests yourself. One command:
git clone && pytest.

This is what scientific publication should look like in 2026.

Today I'm making this work public under a new GitHub organisation: MāyāLucIA.

The name is a conceptual palindrome:

  Māyā → Luc → IA : the measured world, illuminated by AI
  IA → Luc → Māyā : AI shedding light on the constructed world

Shedding light on constructions that are intelligent but artificial.

What MāyāLucIA is NOT:
- A startup or a product
- Automated science
- AI replacing scientists

What it IS:
- A methodology for human-AI scientific collaboration
- A demonstration that one person with deep expertise and the right approach
  can produce rigorous, verified, reproducible science — outside institutional
  walls
- An open invitation to build the same way

The institutions that trained us operate on a timescale of years. The tools
now operate on a timescale of hours. The gap between what one person CAN do
and what one person is ALLOWED to do is wider than it has ever been.

MāyāLucIA is my answer: build in the open, verify everything, hide nothing.
