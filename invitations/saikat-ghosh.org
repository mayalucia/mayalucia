Dear Saikat,

I know you're buried so I won't waste your time with philosophy. I
built something for your instruments and I want you to break it.

* The Demo

Clone this repo and open =site/index.html= in a browser:

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana
open mayapramana/site/index.html
#+end_example

You'll see a Bloch sphere with a spin precessing in real time. Drag
to rotate the view. Move the sliders --- B-field, T_{1}, T_{2}, optical
pumping. Watch the magnetometer signal on the right: M_{x} oscillating,
decaying with T_{2}, recovering with T_{1}. Click "Pure Precession" to
turn off relaxation. Click "Free Induction Decay" to see what your
sensor actually measures.

The RK4 integrator running in the browser solves the same Bloch
equations your magnetometer obeys. It is a digital twin, running in
real time, in 1300 lines of self-contained HTML.

* What This Is

*MāyāPramāṇa* ([[https://github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana]]) --- a
universal quantum sensor controller. Not hardware; a /grammar/ for
what every quantum sensor needs: feedback, estimation, calibration,
noise modelling. Built as digital twins of specific instruments until
the common structure reveals itself.

The first lesson ([[https://github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana/blob/main/lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org][lessons/00-bloch-equations/concept.org]]) implements the
Bloch equations in Python, Haskell, and C++ --- cross-validated
against each other. Same physics, three expressions. The interactive
demo runs a fourth implementation in JavaScript: same equations,
visual output.

The architecture: pure core for physics (deterministic, testable,
hardware-independent), effectful shell for I/O (swappable between
real hardware and simulated twin). The manifesto explains why.

* Why It Reaches Beyond Quantum Optics

The Bloch equations in lesson 00 are the physics of your atomic
magnetometer. They are /also/ NMR, MRI, and the wearable MEG
revolution:

- *OPMs replacing SQUIDs* for brain imaging --- the same alkali-vapor
  technology you build, placed on the scalp at room temperature
- *NV-diamond sensors* approaching single-neuron magnetometry
- *Ultra-low-field MRI* using quantum magnetometer arrays instead of
  superconducting magnets
- *Magnetocardiography* --- portable, non-invasive cardiac screening

The same Kalman filter tracks a drifting field in your lab and a
neural ensemble in a MEG system. The same Fisher information bounds
both. I've written a detailed survey: [[https://github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana/blob/main/applications.org][applications.org]].

We carry electromagnetic fields in our heads. Your sensors are the
technology that makes reading them less hypothetical every year.

* What I'm Asking

Two things, at whatever pace the season allows:

1. *Break the models.* Clone the repo, read the Bloch equations
   lesson, run the tests. Tell me where the physics is wrong, where
   the verification is insufficient, where you'd do it differently.

2. *Join as a partner.* Co-owner of [[https://github.com/mayalucia][MāyāLucIA]] (the
   GitHub organisation), with full authority over direction. Not a
   job, not a startup --- a shared intellectual project between
   physicists. Your contribution is the judgment that no AI has.

* What MāyāLucIA Is

An open research organisation I've been building with AI as
collaborator. Everything tested, everything reproducible:

- *bravli* --- computational neuroscience, /Drosophila/ mushroom
  body, 293 passing tests, verified manuscript ([[https://github.com/mayalucia/bravli]])
- *mayajiva* --- C++ magnetic bug simulation, 23 tests ([[https://github.com/mayalucia/mayajiva]])
- *mayaportal* --- rendering kernel, C++23/WebGPU ([[https://github.com/mayalucia/mayaportal]])

The methodology: measure, model, verify, iterate --- our physicist's
method, accelerated by a machine that writes code fast but cannot
smell when the physics is wrong. That's still my job. And it should
be yours too.

Have a look when the season is right:

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/mayalucia/mayapramana
open mayapramana/site/index.html
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
/Dheere dheere re mana, dheere sab kuch hoye/
/Maali seeche sau ghada, ritu aaye phal hoye/

Slowly, slowly, O my mind --- slowly everything happens.
The gardener may pour a hundred buckets, but fruit comes only
in its season.
--- Kabir
