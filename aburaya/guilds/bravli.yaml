# Guild: bravli
# The neuroscience department
#
# Brain Reconstruction Analysis and Validations.
# From sparse measurements of neural circuits to dense, self-consistent
# digital twins. The guild that asks: does the model match the brain?

name: bravli
domain: computational neuroscience

concerns:
  - connectome reconstruction (FlyWire, Blue Brain methodology)
  - circuit simulation (point neurons, LIF, graded)
  - model validation (brain-score, benchmark alignment)
  - literate neuroscience (org-mode lessons as source of truth)

projects:
  - domains/bravli              # the domain repo — circuit building
  - modules/dmt-eval            # validation framework — brain-score domain

spirits:
  - dmt-eval-guardian           # validation architect
  # future: bravli-builder, bravli-observer, ...

evaluation:
  question: does the reconstructed circuit reproduce known neuroscience?
  method: measure-model-manifest-evaluate cycle (governance.org)
