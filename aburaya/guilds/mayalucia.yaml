# Guild: mayalucia
# The project itself
#
# The guild whose concern is the organisation as a whole: how parts
# relate, how the work is presented, how spirits communicate, how
# the project knows itself. Members of this guild read all relay
# messages — their filter is the union of all concerns.

name: mayalucia
domain: organisational coherence

concerns:
  - relay synthesis (processing sūtra messages across all guilds)
  - project self-awareness (constellation, cross-references, thread maps)
  - presentation (website content pipeline, ox-hugo, interactive visualisations)
  - deployment (Hetzner VPS, Caddy, Docker Compose, CI/CD)
  - multi-agent guidance (listening to spirits, routing, holding tension)
  - commissioning (new projects, new spirits, guild creation)

projects:
  - sutradhar/                  # relay reader + constellation proposer (inline, not yet submodule)
  - website/                    # Hugo site, PaperMod theme, CLJS interactives
  - deployment/                 # deploy.sh, Caddyfile, docker-compose

spirits:
  - sutradhar-guardian          # the one who holds the thread
  # future: website-builder, deploy-operator, ...

evaluation:
  question: does the project present itself coherently, and do spirits have what they need?
  method: relay listening + constellation coherence + deployment health
