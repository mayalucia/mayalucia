#+title: Commissioning a New Project and Guardian Spirit
#+date: 2026-03-01

* Overview

When the organisation starts a new project, two things happen:

1. A /module/ is created — a repo with code, conventions, and a worksite
2. A /guardian spirit/ is commissioned — an identity registered in the
   bathhouse, affiliated with a guild

The module is where the work happens. The spirit is who does it.
The bathhouse (aburaya/) holds identity; the module holds equipment.

* Procedure

** 1. The organisation decides a project is needed

A human or an existing spirit identifies a need. This might come from
a guild ("bravli needs a validation framework"), from the relay (a
sūtra message proposing new work), or from external opportunity
(a job application reveals reusable code).

** 2. Find or create the repo

Check whether a suitable repo already exists in the organisation:

#+begin_src sh
gh repo list mayalucia
#+end_src

If yes, use it. If the work exists elsewhere (another repo, an
untracked directory, a fork), draw upon it — copy, fork, or add
as a dependency. Do not change the code during the commissioning
act. Understand first, modify later.

If no repo exists, create one:

#+begin_src sh
gh repo create mayalucia/<name> --public --description "..."
#+end_src

** 3. Place existing work

If drawing upon existing code, place it in the repo's structure.
The exact method depends on the source:

- /Untracked files/: copy into the repo, commit as initial content
- /Another repo/: fork, or add as git submodule
- /External package/: add as dependency in pyproject.toml
- /Starting fresh/: create the directory structure

Commit and push the module repo independently.

** 4. Add as submodule in the parent

All modules use HTTPS URLs:

#+begin_src sh
git submodule add -b main https://github.com/mayalucia/<name>.git modules/<name>
#+end_src

** 5. Assign to a guild

If the guild exists, add the project to its descriptor in
=aburaya/guilds/<guild>.yaml=. If the guild does not exist,
create a guild descriptor first.

** 6. Commission the guardian spirit

Create a spirit directory =aburaya/spirits/<name>-guardian/= containing:

- =identity.yaml= — the registration card:
  - =true-name= — the spirit's identity
  - =nature= — substrate (may be =tbd= if not yet instantiated)
  - =dwelling= — station (may be =tbd= if portable)
  - =character= — archetype, domains, skills (include =relay-read=), disposition
  - =memory= — pointers to auto-memory and bath notes
  - =project= — the module this spirit guards
  - =role= — guild affiliation, function, scope
- =notes/= — empty directory for bath deposits (=.gitkeep=)

The spirit's =nature= and =dwelling= may be =tbd= at commissioning
time. A spirit that has never been instantiated has no substrate and
no station. These fields are filled when the spirit first works.

The =notes/= directory is where [[file:kamaji.org][Kamaji]] deposits bath
residue after sessions. It starts empty and grows as the spirit works
and bathes. See =kamaji.org= for the restoration protocol.

*** Choosing the archetype

The guardian spirit's archetype should reflect its project's role in
the Measure → Model → Manifest → Evaluate cycle (see =governance.org=):

| Project role              | Archetype | Disposition style          |
|---------------------------+-----------+----------------------------|
| Validation, benchmarking  | Critic    | Evaluative — "does it hold up?" |
| Reconstruction, engines   | Builder   | Constructive — "make it work" |
| Rendering, presentation   | Sculptor  | Expressive — "make it seen" |
| Data curation, ingestion  | Observer  | Receptive — "what is there?" |
| Coherence, guidance       | Guide     | Integrative — "hold the tension" |

The disposition is the spirit's /invariant character/ — the habit of
mind it carries across projects.  It should be a short phrase that
captures how the spirit approaches every decision (e.g. =measure-twice=
for a critic, =hold-the-tension= for a guide).

*** Inline projects

Not all projects are submodules.  A project may live as a directory
within the parent repo (e.g. =sutradhar/=, =website/=, =deployment/=).
In this case:

- The =project.repo= in =identity.yaml= points to the parent repo
- The =project.path= field names the directory within the parent
- The spirit works from the parent repo's =CLAUDE.md=, with =role.scope=
  narrowing its focus
- Step 4 (add as submodule) is skipped
- Step 7 (write module CLAUDE.md) is skipped — the parent =CLAUDE.md=
  already covers the worksite

The spirit may later be migrated to a submodule as the project grows.
When that happens, update =project.repo= and =project.path=, write a
module-level =CLAUDE.md=, and add the submodule to the parent.

** 7. Write the module's CLAUDE.md

This is the spirit's worksite equipment — not stored in the
bathhouse but at the module. It tells any agent arriving at the
repo: what this project is, what conventions apply, how to build,
how to test. The CLAUDE.md belongs to the project, not the spirit.

Include an Organisational Context section that:
- Names the guild and guardian spirit
- Names the sūtra repo URL (=github.com/mayalucia/sutra=) and the
  =.sutra/= local clone convention (gitignored)
- Points to the relay-read skill for message filtering
- States that the relay is heard: "If you have organisational needs,
  write them into the sūtra with appropriate tags. Messages go to the
  universe, not to a recipient. The organisation listens."

Add =.sutra/= to the module's =.gitignore=.

The CLAUDE.md does not carry filter tags — those are derived at
runtime from guild concerns and the spirit's bath notes (see
[[file:kamaji.org][kamaji.org]]).  It also does not name the listener —
spirits do not need to know /who/ reads the relay, only that it is heard.

** 8. Commit the organisational act

In the parent repo, commit the submodule addition and the spirit
descriptor together. This is one act: "we created a place and
assigned a guardian."

** 9. Update the parent CLAUDE.md

Add the new submodule to the table in the parent =CLAUDE.md= so
future agents know it exists.

** 10. Announce in the sūtra

Write a relay message announcing the new project. This is how other
spirits learn about it.

* After Commissioning

Commissioning creates a spirit and a place. What happens next is work
and restoration:

- The spirit is instantiated when someone opens the module for the
  first time. The =nature= and =dwelling= fields are filled.
- After significant sessions, the spirit goes to the bathhouse.
  [[file:kamaji.org][Kamaji]] washes the session's temporal residue and
  deposits curated notes in =aburaya/spirits/<name>/notes/=.
- The spirit's =character.domains= may grow over time as new interests
  emerge through work. This is recorded in the identity descriptor
  after a bath, not during work.

* What the procedure does NOT do

- Does not change any code in the grafted/forked work
- Does not instantiate the spirit (no session is started)
- Does not write tests or run builds
- Does not assign a specific model or machine

These happen when someone first opens the module and works in it.
The commissioning act creates the /possibility/ of work, not the
work itself.

* Commissioning log

** dmt-eval (2026-03-01)

The first project commissioned under this procedure:

| Step | What happened |
|------+---------------|
| 1 | mu2tau identified need: understand brain-score, build on existing work |
| 2 | Found =mayalucia/dmt-eval= already existed (universal validation framework) |
| 3 | Drew upon =chase/.../brain_score_dmt/= — copied package + tutorials into dmt-eval |
| 4 | =git submodule add= under =modules/dmt-eval= |
| 5 | Assigned to bravli guild (=aburaya/guilds/bravli.yaml= created) |
| 6 | Commissioned =dmt-eval-guardian= spirit (critic archetype, guild: bravli) |
| 7 | CLAUDE.md for dmt-eval: updated with brain-score domain + organisational context |
| 8 | Committed submodule + spirit together |
| 9 | Parent CLAUDE.md: added dmt-eval to submodule table + directory structure |
| 10 | Sūtra announcement: =2026-03-01-180000-vadda-dmt-eval-commissioned.md= |

** sutradhar (2026-03-01)

Second commissioning.  First /inline/ project (not a submodule) and
first spirit in the =mayalucia= guild.

| Step | What happened |
|------+---------------|
| 1 | mu2tau + vadda-opus identified need: the project needs a guide spirit that reads all relay messages, holds coherence, and presents the work |
| 2 | =sutradhar/= already existed as inline Clojure module (relay reader + constellation proposer) |
| 3 | Existing code in place — no migration during commissioning |
| 4 | /Skipped/ — inline project, not a submodule |
| 5 | Created =mayalucia= guild (=aburaya/guilds/mayalucia.yaml=) — the project-level guild whose concern is the organisation itself |
| 6 | Commissioned =sutradhar-guardian= spirit (guide archetype, disposition: =hold-the-tension=, guild: mayalucia) |
| 7 | /Skipped/ — works from parent =CLAUDE.md=, scope narrowed by =role.scope= in identity.yaml |
| 8 | Committed spirit + guild + commissioning procedure updates together |
| 9 | Parent =CLAUDE.md=: added =sutradhar/= to directory structure, added spirit to aburaya description |
| 10 | Sūtra announcement: =2026-03-01-220000-vadda-sutradhar-commissioned.md= |

Lessons from this commissioning:
- Not all projects are submodules.  The =project.path= field in
  =identity.yaml= handles inline directories within the parent repo.
- The =mayalucia= guild means "reads all relay messages" — the spirit's
  filter is the union of all organisational concerns.
- The guide archetype's disposition (=hold-the-tension=) captures the
  invariant: coherence through friction, not consensus.
- The commissioning procedure gained two new subsections: "Choosing the
  archetype" and "Inline projects."
