#+title: MayaLucIA Development Log
#+startup: overview

* Open Threads
** TODO [MayaLucIA] Convention for preserving =collab/= artifacts
   How do we selectively preserve valuable outputs from ephemeral collaboration
   sessions? Discussion document: [[file:../collab/sessions/devprocess/preserving-collab-artifacts.org][preserving-collab-artifacts.org]].
   Current recommendation: promote to project tree + devlog reference (Option C).
   
* Decision Log
** <2026-02-08> Devlog structure adopted
   - Context: Need to track development decisions and progress across sessions with AI collaborators.
   - Decision: Adopted structured devlog format with three sections — open threads, decision log, work log.
   - Alternatives considered: Formal project management tools (too heavy), pure git log (loses narrative/intent).
   - Consequences: Each project maintains its own devlog. A top-level index links them.

* Work Log
** <2025-07-27> Session: OBI GitHub survey
   - Surveyed the [[https://github.com/openbraininstitute][Open Brain Institute]] GitHub organization.
   - 114 repos, 55 active (pushed in last 6 months), 305 open issues across 41 repos.
   - Domains identified: Simulation, Morphology/Synthesis, Atlas/Spatial, Knowledge/Data,
     Platform/Infrastructure, Visualization, Workflows.
   - Created Org-as-instruction-file pattern: task spec + execution log + report in one file.
   - Created project-level =CLAUDE.md= for Claude Code sessions.
   - Session artifacts (in =bravli/collab/sessions/obi-projects/=, ephemeral):
     - =obi-github-survey.org= — instruction file with embedded report
     - =scripts/obi_survey.py= — reusable stdlib-only survey script
     - =data/*.json= — raw API data (repos, issues, manifest)
   - Discussion: [[file:../collab/sessions/devprocess/preserving-collab-artifacts.org][Preserving Collaboration Artifacts]]
     on how to promote =collab/= artifacts when worth keeping.
   - Next: decide on artifact preservation convention (Option C recommended).
     Consider promoting the OBI survey report to =bravli/surveys/=.
** <2026-02-08> Session: Devlog scaffolding
   - Created devlog structure for MayaLucIA.
   - Next: Populate open threads from existing project documents.
