This glossary exists so that agents encountering unfamiliar terms can
look them up rather than guess. It is also a reference for human
collaborators joining the project.

Organised by proximity to daily work: core project terms first,
Sanskrit epistemology second, narrative universe third.

* Core Project Terms

These are the terms most likely to cause confusion because they have
project-specific meanings that differ from common usage.

** MāyāLucIA
Personal computational environment for scientific understanding
through creation. /Maya/: creative power (Sanskrit); /Luc/: light;
/IA/: Intelligence Amplifier. Not a product, not a platform — a
framework where science, art, and personal inquiry intertwine.

** Measure → Model → Manifest → Evaluate → Refine
The core methodological cycle. Starting from sparse measurements,
scientific models propagate constraints to reconstruct dense digital
twins. The act of reconstruction /is/ the understanding.

** Digital Twin
A self-consistent computational reconstruction of a natural system
built from sparse data. The twin is not the goal; the comprehension
gained in building it is.

** Radical Hypothesis
Henry Markram's principle: in a complex system, all parameters are
interdependent — laying down a few pieces reveals the missing parts.
The methodological foundation of sparse-to-dense reconstruction.

** Sparse-to-Dense
Moving from kilobytes of measurement data to gigabytes of simulated
reality by exploiting natural coherence and interdependency.

** Sculpting-Agent
The metaphor for the AI collaborator: not rendering pre-conceived
models, but helping reconstruct phenomena through iterative
refinement. The sculpting /process/ is where understanding happens.

** The Sculptor's Paradox
"The tool that offers no resistance teaches nothing." Agents should
push back on flawed reasoning, offer alternatives, flag discomfort.

** The Feynman Imperative
"What I cannot create, I do not understand." Understanding emerges
through building, not observing.

** mu2tau
The human collaborator's handle. PhD theoretical statistical physicist,
20 years across academia and industry. High-proficiency C++ and Python.
Works from Emacs with gptel and org-babel.

** MayaDevGenI
The parent framework for human-machine collaboration — role
archetypes, handoff protocols, memory architecture, orchestration
patterns. MāyāLucIA is an instantiation of MayaDevGenI principles.

* Modules and Domains

** MāyāPortal (=modules/mayaportal=)
Visual Synthesis Kernel — C++23, SDL3, WebGPU. The engine of the
Manifest stage: the viewport through which digital twins become
observable. Branch: =v2=.

** MāyāPramāṇa (=modules/mayapramana=)
Quantum sensor digital twins — pedagogical framework for the
Bell-Bloom atomic magnetometer. Teaches physics, signal processing,
and control theory. Branch: =main=.

** MāyāJīva (=modules/mayajiva=)
Magnetic bug simulation engine — C++20, Godot GDExtension. /Jīva/
(जीव) = living being. Simulates magnetotactic organisms. Branch: =main=.

** Sūtradhār (=sutradhar/=)
The project's self-awareness module. Literate Clojure. Reads the
sūtra relay and git repos, proposes constellation updates. Named after
the narrator-director of Sanskrit drama (see §Sanskrit Terms below).

** Bravli (=domains/bravli=)
Neuroscience domain — brain circuit reconstruction from sparse data.
Builds on Blue Brain / Open Brain Institute methodology. Branch: =main=.

** Parbati (=domains/parbati=)
Himalayan domain — Parvati Valley digital twin. Geology, hydrology,
ecology, human impact. Named after the valley (and the goddess
Pārvatī). Branch: =main=.

** MāyāLoom
Not a tool — a convention for writing org documents as looms on which
human and machine minds weave. Contains: Loom Manifest (header block),
Cadenzas (expansion points), session-continuity conventions. Named
after Kabir's weaving metaphor.

** Cadenza
A marked expansion point in a MāyāLoom document. In music: where the
performer improvises within the composer's harmonic structure. An
=#+BEGIN_CADENZA ... #+END_CADENZA= block with metadata and a prose
prompt body.

* The Sūtra Protocol

** Sūtra (सूत्र)
Literally "thread." A terse, compressed instruction encoding a system
of knowledge (cf. Yoga Sūtras, Pāṇini's grammar). In this project:
the async message-passing protocol and its relay repository at
=github.com/mayalucia/sutra=.

** Relay
The append-only message layer. One file per message:
=YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-<machine>-<slug>.md=. YAML frontmatter: =from=,
=date=, =tags=. No =to:= field — messages go to the universe.
=git log HEAD..origin/main= shows unread messages.

** Standing Card
A small, unsigned instruction document that shapes an agent's
disposition before any human prompt arrives. In the project: maps to
=CLAUDE.md=. From the Thread Walkers fiction: "If the card bore a
name, the weaver might judge the instruction by the authority of the
instructor. Without a name, the instruction must be judged by its
content."

* Collaboration Conventions

** Autonomy Agreement
A negotiated, evolving document specifying epistemic commitments,
autonomy levels, transition protocol, and invariants. Four levels:
*Apprentice* → *Colleague* → *Delegate* → *Collaborator*. Versioned
in git; the commit log is the amendment history.

** Three-Face Protocol
Artifact organisation for collaboration tasks: =discuss.org=
(deliberation record), =plan.org= (human face — why before what),
=spec.org= (machine face — exact paths, signatures, done-when). If
plan and spec disagree, plan is authoritative.

** Dual-Channel Principle
In literate org documents, prose (for humans) and code (for machines)
are co-equal channels. Neither is subordinate. The prose is not
"comments for the code."

** Tānā-Bānā (ताना-बाना)
Hindi weaving terms. /Tānā/ = warp (the fixed structure, the human-
written org document). /Bānā/ = weft (the generative passes, the
agent's contributions). Subtitle of MāyāLoom.

** Co-Ownership
"A property of the artifact, not of the machine." Code carries enough
structure and context that either party can pick it up.

** .attic/
Gitignored local directory for archived artifacts needing human review.
Local-only, does not sync.

* Agent Identities

** vadda
Machine identifier for the MacBook (Dropbox) agent. Format:
=vadda/claude-opus-4.6=.

** mahakali (mahak.)
Machine identifier for a second agent instance. Named after Mahākālī.

* Sanskrit Terms (Epistemological)

These terms from Indian philosophy are used structurally in the
project, not decoratively.

** Pramāṇa (प्रमाण)
"Valid cognition" — the means by which reliable knowledge is obtained.
The Nyāya school admits four: pratyakṣa, anumāna, upamāna, śabda.
The Buddhist tradition (Dignāga, Dharmakīrti) admits two.

** Pratyakṣa (प्रत्यक्ष)
Direct perception. Raw, non-conceptual. The sensor meets the field.
Computationally: what the local model can handle directly.

** Anumāna (अनुमान)
Inference. The mind builds structure from raw impression.
Computationally: what requires the frontier model's capacity for
long-range reasoning.

** Śabda (शब्द)
Authoritative testimony. Requires an /āpta/ (trustworthy authority).
Whether AI qualifies as āpta is genuinely open.

** Upamāna (उपमान)
Analogy — learning about one system by comparing it to another.
"The magnetometer teaches us about the MRI."

** Arthakriyāsāmarthya (अर्थक्रियासामर्थ्य)
Dharmakīrti's criterion: the capacity for effective action. Knowledge
that does not enable action is not knowledge.

** Āpta (आप्त)
Trustworthy authority — the condition for testimony (śabda) to count
as valid cognition.

* Sanskrit Terms (Dramatic & Cultural)

** Sūtradhār (सूत्रधार)
The narrator-director of Sanskrit drama. /Sūtra/ (thread) + /dhār/
(holder). Before the first actor speaks, the sūtradhār walks onstage,
addresses the audience, and establishes context.

** Nāṭyaśāstra
The classical treatise on performing arts (Bharata Muni). Source of the
sūtradhār role and the rasa theory.

** Rasa (रस)
Aesthetic mood — established by the sūtradhār at a performance's
opening. Nine canonical rasas in the Nāṭyaśāstra.

** Pūrvaraṅga (पूर्वरङ्ग)
The prologue of a Sanskrit drama, introduced by the sūtradhār.

** Paramparā (परम्परा)
Tradition, lineage. The guru-śiṣya paramparā: immersion-based
transmission from teacher to student (cf. Indian classical music).

** Guru-Śiṣya (गुरु-शिष्य)
Teacher-student relationship. Despite apparent hierarchy, insists that
the guru is also changed by the relationship.

** Turīya (तुरीय)
"The Fourth." From the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. Not a state alongside
waking, dreaming, and deep sleep — the ground in which all three
arise. In the project: the collaboration itself, neither human nor
machine.

** Māyā (माया)
Creative power; wondrous power; measurable reality. Multiple meanings
coexist: (1) the power to form, to turn idea into measured reality;
(2) the phenomenal world that can be quantified; (3) the magical net
of computational forms. Also: MAYA Principle — "Most Advanced Yet
Acceptable."

** Jīva (जीव)
Living being, life force. Root of MāyāJīva.

* Narrative Universe

The "sutra-genesis" stories encode project philosophy in fiction. Key
terms for agents encountering these texts:

- *Thread Walkers*: fictional guild — parable of the sūtra relay.
  Weavers share patterns via knotted cords across Himalayan passes.
- *Standing Card*: see §Sūtra Protocol above.
- *Doridhar*: fictional village of amnesiac cartographers — parable
  of the constellation browser. Each morning a new cartographer reads
  the note and explores without memory.
- *The Glass Plate*: the constellation browser in story form.
- *The Instrument Maker*: character in Sangla who builds calibration
  instruments for users she will never meet — parable of protocol
  design.
- *The Fourth Valley*: working title for a planned science-fiction
  work using the Māṇḍūkya framework as ontology.
- *Khipu*: Andean knotted-cord records (Inca). Cautionary example:
  "a notation whose readers are extinct is imprisoned information."
